 Continued surveillance is recommended. Report dictated by: ***** ***** *****, MD, signed by: ***** ***** *****, MD Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging        Relevant New Pathology:  09/09/19 FNA Pancreatic Tail Mass  A: Pancreas tail mass, Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle  aspiration biopsy: Adenocarcinoma; see comment.  COMMENTS:   The aspirate material shows invasive ductal carcinoma of the pancreas.  Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the status of DNA  mismatch repair protein expression on block A1. The results in the tumor  cell nuclei are:  MLH1 expression: Present.   PMS2 expression: Present.  MSH2 expression: Present.  MSH6 expression: Present.    Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Ms. ***** is a 73 y.o. female with locally advanced PDAC on mFOLFIRINOX (C1=10/22/19).  She presents for follow up.    Overall plan is for 4-6 months of upfront chemotherapy with q2mo scans. At the end of a period of induction chemotherapy,  we could consider either (1) readdressing her surgical prospects with Dr. *****, although based on her local extent of disease it may be challenging to achieve an R0 resection; or (2)consolidative chemoradiation,either conventionally fractionated therapy with concurrent capecitabine as a radiosensitizer, or SBRT. Of note, for patients who do successful go onto surgery following induction FOLFIRINOX, we have often observed excellent(sometimes near-complete) pathologic responses.     Unfortunately C1 of mFOLFIRINOX on 10/22/19 was complicated by colitis with bloody diarrhea, low ANC, decreased PO intake and hypokalemia requiring 2x IVF in infusion, and addition IV potassium.  I then dose reduced irinotecan to 120mg/m2 for delayed C2 on 11/19/19, and also added Fulphila for growth factor support.  However, this was also poorly tolerated, with persistent fatigue, poor appetite, weight loss. Per her preference, C3 was delayed by 1 week from 
 December 03.  Given her frequent trt delays and rise in CA 19-9 (5000-->11K), I obtained an early look CT CAP on 12/10/19 which fortunately shows stable disease without evidence of distant metastases. It did, however, show colitis, though symptomatically her diarrhea was improving.     As such, I omitted irinotecan with C3.  She has tolerated subsequent cycles of FOLFOX alone quite well.     # Locally Advanced PDAC:   -Labs, PS ok for C6D1 treatment  today, 01/21/20  Omitted irinotecan since C3 (due to colitis on scans, performance status).  Will continue with FOLFOX only going forward:   -oxaliplatin 85mg/m2, 5FU 2400mg/m2 over 46h   -Aloxi, aprepitant, dexamethasone as premeds, with prn ativan D1   -1L NS, 12mg PO dexamethasone, prn Zofran, ativan on D3  -omit D3 Fulphila given ANC >20 today  -Note that pt's CA 19-9 jumped in the setting of colitis.  Improving now   -Plan for scans again after C8, monthly CA 19-9    # Diarrhea: Resolved though exacerbated by certain foods, bl June 14 soft bm.   CT 12/10/19 with evidence of colitis.    --stopped irinotecan with C3.    --couseled regarding BRAT diet, and avoiding dairy for now  --has prn loperamide Rx    # Electrolyte Abnormalities:   -K : 2.9. Plan for 20mEq IV +40mEq PO (with 4x Klor Con 10 mEq pills) on D1.  On D3, will repeat K and Mg: give  20mEq IV +40mEq PO (with 4x Klor Con 10 mEq pills) only if K <=3.3. Hold if >3,3  -Mg 1.5: Receiving 1g today,   --Will send Rx for Klor Con which she prefers dt size-->advised to take 20 mEq daily  -Again, reviewed potassium rich foods (eg bananas, potatoes)  -will consider renal evaluation to r/o RTA as cause of hypokalemia if not improvement    (Note: Previously sent rx for liquid K and MicroK neither of which she has tolerated)    # Weight loss:   -counseled that now is not the time to intentionally lose weight--encouraged her to find foods she enjoys eating, and to maintain weight    # R breast nodule: Recommended diagnostic 
 mammogram  -scheduled for mammogram 11/26/19--cancelled-->will revisit    # Genetic Risk: S/p genetic testing.  VUS in RECQL4 c.*****>G (p.*****)    # Financial Resources:   -- Financial Assistance application approved, now covered.    #Follow Up: 2w      I spent a total of 30 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 30 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the treatment plan and symptoms.    The above plan was reviewed with the patient and all questions and issues were addressed to the patient's satisfaction.      ***** ***** MD, MPH  Assistant Professor of Clinical Medicine   Gastrointestinal Oncology Program   University of *****, ***** *****  Office Phone Number: *****-*****-*****

His recent medical history includes imaging for aspergillosis which revealed a pancreatic mass.    Staging CT scan of the abdomen at that time showed nodal involvement and invasion of the duodenum and abutment of the superior mesenteric vein. partial obstruction is also noted.    *****/*****/*****-*****/*****/*****: UCSF admission for acute symptomatic anemia (s/p transfusion and iron) 2/2 presumed bleed 2/2 pancreatic uncinate adenocarconima with invasion to duodenal wall s/p EGD/EUS with biopsies that showed evidence of adenocarcinoma. After intervention he developed fever with leukocytosis that was attributed to procedure with resolution in absence of abx or further investigation.    *****/*****/*****-*****/*****/*****: Admitted at ***** after presenting to ED with sudden onset respiratory distress, found to have sepsis 2/2 acute on chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure 2/2 R-sided PNA.     04/29/21: Initial consultation with Dr. *****. Patient recommended to initiate FOLFIRINOX. But first patient was recommended to complete C Diff treatment (Vanco), and document neg c diff stool antigen, and then proceed with FOLFIRINOX.    *****/*****/*****-*****/*****/*****: Admitted at ***** for CBD obstruction, gastric outlet obstruction, duodenal obstruction s/p stents to duodenum and CBD with poor PO intake, with course now c/b pancreatitis. Pt underwent EGD/EUS/ERCP 05/06/21 with placement of biliary and duodenal 
 metal stents. Newly identified development of nonocclusive thrombi within the superior mesenteric vein and its branches.     06/03/21: Patient presented for C1D1 Gem/Cape and treatment was held d/t HGB 7.5. Patient refused blood transfusion that day.   06/06/21: Patient received 1 unit PRBC    06/08/21: CT CAP completed d/t increased RUQ pain. IMPRESSION:  - Compared to 05/12/2021, unchanged size of large pancreatic head/unicinate mass. No new suspicious lesions in the abdomen or pelvis.   - Interval resolution of pancreatic inflammatory changes.  - Unchanged position of duodenal and common bile duct stents with further decrease in biliary ductal dilation.   - Suggestion of new rectal wall thickening and hyperemia in the setting of large stool burden and distention that may reflect stercoral colitis.   - Compared to 03/15/2021, slight interval increase in size of mediastinal and bilateral hilar lymph nodes which are borderline enlarged by CT size criteria. Additional apparent increase in patchy groundglass opacities and centrilobular nodules although direct comparison is somewhat limited due to differences in slice thickness between studies. These findings are favored to represent acute infection including viral infection or drug reaction and are similar to although less conspicuous than on more remote prior study from 11/10/2020.    06/09/21: C1D1 Gemcitabine + Capecitabine   06/15/21: Patient fell outside of LabCorp while walking down the stairs  06/23/21: C1D15 Gem/Cape.

Dr ***** and Dr. ***** were present. We reviewed images. Not resectable now as SMA involved and tumor low in mesentery. Plan was to evaluate for for Rad Onc for bleeding control.     08/11/21: Consultation with Dr. *****.   Impression: locally advanced pancreas 
 cancer, he is currently unresectable due to extensive vascular involvement at the root of the mesentery.  followup with Dr. ***** regarding continuing systemic regimen vs starting different regimen. Consider radiation.    08/18/21: C3D15 Gem/Cape  08/25/21: Consultation with Dr. *****, Rad Onc. Recommendations:  If they decide to proceed with radiotherapy, we discussed either 5 fraction low dose radiation purely to stop his duodenal bleeding, 5 fraction SBRT for tumor control, or 25 fraction capecitabine-radiotherapy for tumor control.  If SBRT, treatment will be given in 5 treatment sessions over the course of 2 weeks.   We discussed the potential short and long term side effects of radiotherapy, as well as the logistics of radiation, including CT simulation, radiation planning, and actual treatments.  We discussed that with fractionated therapy, we can deliver higher radiation dose to the tumor for potentially better durability of local control, but that no randomized data proves its superiority of SBRT.  At this point, ***** ***** and his daughter did not want to schedule any appointment, preferring first to discuss with Dr. *****.    Plan:  1) Patient uncertain about SBRT vs. Fractionated chemoRT vs new multiagent systemic therapy at this point.  2) No fiducial needed due to involvement of nearby visualizable vessels    09/01/21: C4D1 Gem/Cape   Had one episode of vomiting around 11/08/21.  No hematemesis.   November 22 changed the jejunal stent.   11/10/21 C6D15  Went to ED 12/02/21   XRT  12/08/21--> 12/22/21  12/22/21 ***** (ID) visit: recommended repeat CT scan at some point.

Iohexol 350 - 100 mL - Intravenous RADIATION DOSE INDICATORS: Exposure Events: 3 , CTDIvol Max: 4 mGy, DLP: 158.9 mGy.cm FINDINGS: SUPPORT DEVICE(S): Right chest port 
 catheter terminates at the superior cavoatrial junction. LUNGS: Increased upper lobe predominant peribronchovascular groundglass/perilobular opacities. Increased atelectasis in the right middle lobe and lingula. New nodular consolidation in the left lower lobe (series 301, image 364). PLEURA: No pleural effusion. MEDIASTINUM: A few mediastinal nodes have increased in size. For reference, an AP window node measures 0.6 cm in short axis, previously 0.4 cm (series 2, image 96). These are probably reactive to regional inflammation. Mild diffuse esophageal wall thickening, nonspecific. HEART/GREAT VESSELS: Normal heart size. No pericardial effusion. Mild coronary artery calcifications. BONES/SOFT TISSUES: No suspicious lesion. VISIBLE ABDOMEN: Increased pneumobilia with intrahepatic and extra hepatic biliary ductal dilation. Thickened, enhancing walls of the hepatic, cystic, and upper common bile ducts, similar to prior exam. Partially imaged common bile duct stent. Several small vessels course along the gastric wall, as seen previously. Partially imaged gastrostomy stent communicating with a left upper quadrant bowel loop. Partially imaged stent within the more posterior lateral aspect of this same bowel loop. Mildly enlarged enhancing node adjacent to the central mesenteric vascular pedicle measuring 1.0 cm in short axis (series 2, image 258). Mild adjacent haziness of the central mesenteric vascular pedicle. Otherwise unremarkable.     1.  Compared 11/18/2021, increased bilateral upper lobe predominant pulmonary opacities compatible with organizing pneumonia pattern lung injury. Considerations include viral infection and/or medication-induced pulmonary injury. 2.  Background of clustered nodules and nodular consolidation compatible with chronic airway infection. 3.

Based on the tumor size and multifocal nature, the patient was referred to discuss neoadjuvant chemotherapy.     We discussed that the metaplastic aspect of her cancer is rare and portends a more aggressive biology - therefore we strongly encouraged neoadjuvant therapy and consideration of the trial with the potential benefit of receiving a promising experimental agent.    We discussed with ***** in great detail the natural history and treatment of locally advanced triple negative breast cancer.  We informed the patient that she currently has no evidence of metastatic disease and that we can therefore treat her with curative intent.  We reviewed the pathology report and discussed the multimodality approach of breast cancer treatment.  The patient understands that treatment will include chemotherapy, surgery, hormonal therapy, and potentially radiation therapy depending on her surgical choice and final pathology.  We discussed the advantages of offering chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting in order to assess response to treatment, and to increase the chances of breast conserving surgery.     We discussed the chemotherapy regimens that would be recommended as the standard of care, and discussed how these regimens would be different in the context of the I-SPY2 clinical trial.  We explained that in the context of her higher risk triple 
 negative metaplastic disease we would typically recommend that she receive either 12 cycles of weekly paclitaxel followed by 4 cycles of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide (AC) every 2 weeks.  We explained that in the context of I-SPY2, patients are randomized to a control or to receive an experimental agent in addition to paclitaxel.   If she is randomized to an experimental therapy, then we will discuss that drug in more detail at that time.    The patient is very interested in the I-SPY2 clinical trial and has already consented. She has done the MRI, research biopsy, and Echo, mammaprint is pending and the echo looks good.  Her labs revealed an elevated creatinine and Alk phos, and she may have been dehydrated.  We will check these again    We explained that if her tumor has a Mammaprint low risk profile, she would not be eligible to participate in the therapeutic portion of the trial, but given the metaplastic aspect I am fairly certain it will be high risk.  If for some reason it is not, we will need to re-assess the diagnosis of metaplastic breast cancer and we could present her case to our multidisciplinary tumor Board.    We specifically discussed the typical and less common side-effects associated with AC/T, such as fatigue, neuropathy, skin and nail changes, myalgias, alopecia, myelosuppression, nausea.      She will benefit from a Medi-port, which was explained to her and to which she has agreed.  We will arrange for chemo teaching session, and while we could start therapy as early as next week the patient is needing a little more time to arrange things with work and would prefer to start the first week in February which we will plan for.     The patient asked about her genetic predisposition to this cancer - and we will discuss this further with her when we have the results of the gene panel that has been sent.     Pt visit was 55 min, with >50% of the time spent on counseling.

test_4	1	"This is an independent service.  The available consultant for this service is ***** ***** *****, MD.       PATIENT IDENTIFICATION: Mr. ***** is a 53 y.o. male who returns to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of his diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with biopsy-proven oligo metastatic disease in the abdominal wall.    ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:   He first presented with abdominal pain and weight loss. On 01/10/2019, he had a CT of the abdomen which showed a mass in the pancreas which encased the celiac axis along with a concerning soft tissue nodule in the abdominal wall at midline.      02/06/19: CT PET showed a hypermetabolically active large pancreatic tail mass abutting adjacent structures, although the lesion in the abdominal wall was slightly PET avid (SUV 1.2).     01/22/19: EUS directed FNA of the pancreatic lesion revealed a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma, MSS.    02/14/19: Biopsy of abdominal wall nodule showed metastatic adenocarcinoma.    03/08/19: Patient presented for C1D1 FOLFIRINOX and labs revealed hyperbilirubinemia (t bili 1.7). Per patient report, he has h/o hyperbilirubinemia and diagnosed ~2 years ago with possible Gilbert syndrome. Irinotecan was held and he proceeded with C1D1 FOLFOX.    03/19/19: C2D1 FOLFIRINOX. T bili was 0.8. Dr. ***** recommended that patient proceed with Irinotecan and closely follow patient for possible irinotecan toxicities.   04/02/19: C3D1 FOLFIRINOX    04/30/19: C4D1 FOLFIRINOX    05/15/19: CT CAP showed stable pancreatic mass and slight decreased size of anterior abdominal wall lesion  05/16/19: C5D1 FOLFIRINOX    05/18/19: US with doppler LE revealed segmental occlusive thrombi within the superior and mid duplicated left peroneal veins. Patient started on xarelto.   05/28/19: C6D1 FOLFIRINOX. CA 19-9 = 2,528    06/11/19: C7D1 FOLFIRINOX    06/25/19: C8D1 FOLFIRINOX. CA 19-9 = 995    07/06/19: CT CAP shows continued 
 response to treatment   07/09/19: C9D1 FOLFIRINOX    07/11/19: CA 19-9 = 588  07/25/19: Treatment held (Cycle 10) d/t thrombocytopenia (PLT 95)  08/01/19: C10D1 FOLFIRINOX. CA 19-9 = 826  08/13/19: C11D1 FOLFIRINOX    09/03/19: C12D1 FOLFIRINOX  (Last cycle)  09/10/19: CT CAP stable disease in the pancreas and abdominal wall lesion. Patient was recommended to start chemotherapy break.     10/03/19: Per patient's request, his case was presented at Pancreas Tumor Board to see if he is a candidate for surgical resection. His pancreas mass is not resectable for multiple reasons, primarily because of extensive vessel involvement and encasement. Dr. ***** ***** recommended consolidation radiation due to the fact that his pancreas tumor is abutting the stomach and concerns over the complications that this will likely lead to. However, Dr. ***** does not recommend radiation therapy at this time since patient is asymptomatic.     INTERVAL HISTORY:   ***** has been feeling generally well. Continues to have some oral thrush.

 Polycystic ovaries 12/26/2016     Last Assessment & Plan:   Long history of amenorrhea, in the last year, they have increased to almost monthly.  Now, increased pain with ovulation and periods, they are heavier and clotting.       Cyst of breast 06/16/2015     Last Assessment & Plan:   HISTORY/REASON FOR EXAM: 2 left breast lumps noted on self breast examination.  TECHNIQUE/EXAM DESCRIPTION: Unilateral LEFT digital diagnostic mammography was performed and interpreted with CAD, limited left breast ultrasound.  COMPARISON: 11/26/14 and 06/01/09.  FINDINGS:  3 views of the left breast were obtained.  The breast tissue is extremely dense.  There are is a large rounded benign-appearing nodule in the inferior medial periareolar region of the left breast at the site of one lump.  There is dense breast parenchyma in the lateral mid anterior portion of the left breast at the site of a second lump which was marked.  No spiculated mass or suspicious calcification is identified.  Limited left breast ultrasound: There is a large cyst containing one thin partial septation located at the 10:30 position 1 cm from the nipple measuring 3.9 x 3.0 x 2.1 cm. This accounts for one of the 2 palpable nodules.  There is a small simple cyst at the 3:00 position 3 cm from the nipple measuring 4.2 x 3.8 x 3.3 mm. This accounts for the second palpable nodule.  No solid nodule is present.  IMPRESSION:  1. 2 simple cysts in the left breast accounting for the palpable abnormalities.  2. Cyst aspiration of the larger cyst could be performed if pain persists.  3. If symptoms resolve routine bilateral followup mammography in November 2015 is recommended.  The results were given to the patient at the time of visit.      Mass of breast 05/12/2015     Last Assessment & Plan:   mammo done November 2014.      1. BREASTS ARE EXTREMELY DENSE, WHICH LOWERS SENSITIVITY OF MAMMOGRAPHY. NO GROSS EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY AND NO INTERVAL CHANGE.    2. SCREENING MAMMOGRAM 
 IN ONE YEAR IS RECOMMENDED.    Recently found a couple of lumps left breast.  No nipple discharge.  Some discomfort left breast      Neck pain 05/12/2015     Last Assessment & Plan:   Had a MVA last  *****.  Went to ***** ***** ***** for workup.  She recalls imaging as negative.  She continues to have neck pain radiating to left shoulder.  Underwent PT, this made it worse.  She is undergoing rolfing and would like to try some muscle relaxers to take prior to the sessions.  Numbness and tingling in left arm.  Her hand will shake with weight.  Her arm symptoms predated the MVA.

We discussed the biology of her cancer, and the prevalence.  We reviewed the imaging and her pathology in detail.  I reviewed the data that supports the use of ovarian suppression in woman with HR+ breast cancer under the age of 35, as the general duration of endocrine therapy which at present would be 5 years.  She was curious about the benefits relatively of shorter duration endocrine therapy , and whether two years would be good enough - and we 
 reviewed that the current studies are based on the knowledge that 5 years is not good enough for many cancers like this due to late recurrence risks, so we would not advise shorter durations.    We then talked about different endocrine therapy approaches.  I would be concerned about using tamoxifen alone, both for efficacy which what appears to be at least a 2 cm cancer on exam and for the risks of depression that could be difficult given her underlying bipolar II disorder.    We discussed to toxicities of OS with monthly goserelin, as well as the toxicities of tamoxifen versus an AI.  She would prefer to start with an AI, and I have told her that we will wait two weeks to at least have OS start working.

test_7	1	"SUBJECTIVE:    This is a very pleasant 47-year-old African-American gentleman with a diagnosis of locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. He presented with several months of vague abdominal discomfort and had some gross hematuria in September. He went to ***** Hospital and a CT scan was done which revealed a pancreatic mass. His hematuria was felt to be secondary to renal lithiasis. This problem resolved.    He was noted to have biliary obstruction and underwent an ERCP with an EUS at ***** on October 24. A plastic stent was placed. Fine-needle aspiration of the mass revealed adenocarcinoma.    When I initially saw him, he had lost 43 pounds and was having a lot of pain. We elected to start gemcitabine and Abraxane. He's completed 6 full cycles. At the end of 2 cycles, his CT scan suggested progression. However, since he was doing so well clinically, we felt that this represented pseudo-progression.    His 5th cycle treatment was interrupted because of biliary ductal obstruction. He had a plastic stent was replaced with an uncovered metal stent. Apparently there was a lot of pus and material that drained at the time of that procedure and he was placed on IV and oral antibiotics. Since the procedure, he has had intermittent abdominal discomfort, usually at night, requiring oxycodone.     He feels that his appetite has returned. He's gained kilogram last month. He notices some numbness and tingling in his hands but it doesn't interfere with his function. He is having regular bowel movements.    He would like to meet with psycho oncology as he is having some difficulty coping with his disease and with some social and economic issues.    His girlfriend gave birth to a baby girl on April 27.     PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:     MEDICAL ILLNESSES:  Hypertension, voluntarily stopped his antihypertensive    PRIOR SURGERIES:  Drainage of a perirectal abscess, age 17    INJURIES:  None reported    CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  See 
 intake    ALLERGIES:  Allergies   Allergen Reactions    Penicillins Hives       FAMILY HISTORY:  There is no cancer among his first-degree relatives. He has 2 siblings. His maternal grandmother had colorectal cancer diagnosed at age 55. A paternal grandmother may have colorectal cancer, age of diagnosis uncertain.    SOCIAL HISTORY:  He smoked about a half a pack of cigarettes per day for about 4 years, quitting in 2006. There is a prior history of alcohol abuse where he drank up to a pint of tequila day, but he has been drinking only socially more recently. He has a past history of heroin abuse, but has not used for several years.

TECHNIQUE: Following the administration of 150 cc of Omnipaque 350, contiguous 1.25-mm collimation axial 
 images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis. The gastrointestinal tract was opacified with oral and rectal  contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformats were also obtained. FINDINGS: Visualized lung bases:  For chest findings, please see the separately dictated report from the CT of the chest of the same date. Bones:  No suspicious lesions Liver:  6 mm hypervascular lesion in hepatic segment 8 which may reflect flash filling hemangioma or portosystemic shunt, unchanged from prior No significant intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. Gallbladder:  Unremarkable Spleen:  Unremarkable Pancreas:  Redemonstration of ill-defined hypoattenuating mass centered in the pancreatic head, extending to the pancreatic tail, and involving the portosplenic confluence and superior mesenteric vein. Although difficult to measure this appears minimally increased in size and appears prior. Minimally decreased pancreatic duct dilatation to 7 mm in the pancreatic tail. The stent has been changed in courses from the common hepatic duct into the duodenum persistent pneumobilia suggests patency. Adrenal Glands:  Unremarkable Kidneys:  Unremarkable GI Tract:  No bowel obstruction. Pancreatic mass continues to abut the duodenum, unchanged from prior. Vasculature: No significant change in vascular involvement. Lymphadenopathy: Small mesenteric and retroperitoneal nodes, none of which are enlarged by size criteria. Ascites: Absent Bladder: Unremarkable Reproductive organs: Unremarkable Extraperitoneal soft tissues: Unremarkable     1.  Stable to minimally increased size of pancreatic mass compatible with known pancreatic adenocarcinoma. 2.  No evidence of metastatic disease in the abdomen/pelvis. END OF IMPRESSION:     Ct Chest With Contrast    Result Date: 06/10/2016  CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST CLINICAL HISTORY:  Panceatic cancer COMPARISON: 03/18/2016 and earlier TECHNIQUE: Serial 1.25 mm axial images through the chest were obtained after the 
 administration of intravenous contrast. RADIATION DOSE INDICATORS: ***** ***** received 2 exposure event(s) (excluding scout) during this CT study.

FINDINGS: LUNGS: Few new small nodules in the left lower lobe measuring up to 3 mm (series 2, images 121, 138, 166, 170) and a 7 mm new nodule in the lingula. Previously noted tiny nodule in the peripheral right upper lobe (prior study series 2, image 90) is not visualized on this exam. Right middle lobe nodule is unchanged (series 2, image 129). PLEURA: No pleural effusion. MEDIASTINUM: 8 mm lymph node adjacent to the inferior vena cava (previously 7 mm; series 2, image 179). No lymphadenopathy by size criteria. HEART/GREAT VESSELS: Normal heart size. No pericardial effusion. BONES/SOFT TISSUES: No suspicious lesions. VISIBLE ABDOMEN: Please see dedicated Abdomen and Pelvis CT report.     1.  5 new nodules measuring up to 7 mm in the lingula and left lower lobe. These are indeterminate 
 but are suspicious for metastases in the setting of known pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Attention on follow-up. 2.  No other definite evidence of metastatic disease in the chest. END OF IMPRESSION:       ASSESSMENT:  1. Locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, with possible progression  2. Hypertension  3. Possible cancer family syndrome  4. ECOG 0     PLAN:    The new lung nodules are concerning but these are unlikely to become a problem for him. He would really like a chemotherapy break. This seems reasonable since he appears to have received maximum benefit on this regimen. Given the sites of disease involvement and his lack of symptoms, I think it would be safe to put him on surveillance. We'll see him again in 2 months for follow-up. I spent 20 minutes in face-to-face consultation with the patient and his mother today going over all aspects of his care and management.
