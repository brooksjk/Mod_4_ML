As you know, she is a 59-year-old woman who had four benign axillary  lymph nodes resected from her left axilla 10 years ago at ***** *****.  Subsequent to that time, she has had yearly mammograms which were  unremarkable.  In 2007 she had a fine needle aspiration of her right  breast that was read as benign.  In March 2010, an exam was felt to  represent no change in her breast.  In May she had planned on a  screening mammogram; however, two weeks before this mammogram, the  patient felt that her left breast had an area of increased density.  The  mammogram was unremarkable, but an ultrasound performed on June 07  revealed a focal shadowing measuring 2 x 1.5 cm in 10 o'clock that was  suspicious.  A core biopsy on the same day revealed invasive lobular  carcinoma, grade 2-3, measuring at least 1.5 cm.  This lobular cancer  was ER positive with 96% of the cells staining, PR positive with 35% of  cells staining and HER-2/neu negative with 0 cells staining.    An MRI of her bilateral breasts was performed in *****, although the  patient lives in *****; this revealed a large abnormality in her left  breast, over 5.3 cm in AP extent by 1.8 x 3.6 cm.    On 
 June 29 the patient saw Dr. ***** ***** at *****.  Dr. *****  palpated a large mass in the left breast and was concerned about the  extent of her disease.  She ordered a PET/CT scan which was performed on  July 06; this revealed hypermetabolic enhancing left breast mass, with  associated left axillary and left subpectoral nodes.  There was no  evidence of distant metastatic disease.  Specifically, the enhancing  lesion in the left breast measured 3.8 x 1.3 cm, but had a low SUV of  1.9; there were subcentimeter left axillary and left subpectoral nodes;  the largest left axillary node measured 0.6 cm and the largest  subpectoral node measured 0.7 cm.  In addition to these findings there  was a 7 mm hypoattenuating nodule on the right lobe of the thyroid gland  that was hypermetabolic with an SUV of 2.4.  Because of this thyroid  nodule, an ultrasound and fine needle aspiration of this lesion was  performed on July 08; this revealed a benign thyroid nodule, colloid  type.    In addition, to the pathology, the core biopsy that was performed in  ***** was reviewed by our pathologist, they agreed with the outside  pathologist that this represented invasive lobular carcinoma, with the  maximum dimension of 1.1 cm; they felt that this was intermediate grade.  There was no lymphovascular invasion.  ER and PR were strongly positive  and HER-2 was negative.    She came to see me to discuss treatment options.    PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Her past medical history is remarkable for  hypertension for 30 years, on medications.  She states that her blood  pressure has been well controlled over these last 30 years, but her  hypertension did develop in her late 20s.  She had a hysterectomy and  bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy at age 35 for fibroids with bleeding.  She had a tonsillectomy and she had a right wrist fracture as a child.  Two years ago she slipped and fell and herniated her disk at L3-4; she  was treated with physical 
 therapy and ice and has no residual pain at  this time.    GYN HISTORY:  She underwent menarche at 11.  She is G0, P0.  She took  hormone replacement therapy very briefly after menopause and then  stopped.  Her last menstrual period was of course, before her  hysterectomy as noted above.  She took soy and black cohosh for hot  flashes in the past, but these are much improved now.    MEDICATIONS INCLUDE:  Hydrochlorothiazide, potassium and Exforge which  she takes for her blood pressure.    ALLERGIES:  She is allergic to erythromycin with chest pain and sulfa,  with a rash.    SOCIAL HISTORY:  She has been divorced for many years.  She works full  time as a ***** for ***** ***** and ***** ***** in  administration.  She exercises a little bit.  She does not smoke  cigarettes or drink alcohol.    FAMILY HISTORY:  Her mother had Parkinson's disease in her older years  and she does not know anything about her father's history.    REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She notes that she has a high tolerance for pain.  She has noted right breast aching that is gradually increasing with a  dull throbbing, this has gotten significantly worse over the last couple  of weeks and has made her very anxious.  She has been using ice packs.  She notes dry eyes.  She has no back pain.  Her energy level is good,  although as noted, she is not very physically active.  She is not  shortness of breath.  She has no cough or abdominal pain and no problems  with her balance.  The rest of her review of systems is negative in  detail.    PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL:  On physical examination, she is a healthy appearing woman in  no acute distress.  VITAL SIGNS:  Her weight is 77 kg, her blood pressure is 123/86, pulse  91, respirations 14 and she is saturating at 99% on room air and is  afebrile.  SKIN:  Her skin reveals no lesions.  HEENT : Her oropharynx is clear.  She is anicteric.  She has no cervical  adenopathy.  She has a 1 cm left 
 supraclavicular or anterior cervical  node that feels benign.  LUNGS:  Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally to auscultation  and percussion and she has no bony tenderness.  BREASTS:  Examination of her right breast reveals no masses.  She has a  0.5 cm soft and mobile right axillary lymph node.  Examination of her  left breast reveals a 5 x 5.5 cm mass that extends to underneath the  nipple, but originates at 12 o'clock.  She has a 1 cm palpable left  axillary lymph node.  CARDIAC:  Her cardiac exam is without murmur or gallops.  ABDOMEN:  Her abdomen is soft and nontender, without  hepatosplenomegaly.  EXTREMITIES:  Her extremities reveal no edema.    In summary, ***** ***** is a 59-year-old woman with a new diagnosis of  a clinical stage III lobular carcinoma of the left breast.  On PET/CT  scan there is evidence of local regional node involvement; therefore, we  ordered an ultrasound on the day of her visit, which she accomplished  the following week.  The ultrasound revealed a 1.3 x 0.7 x 1.2 cm left  axillary lymph node which was abnormal in morphology, with a thickened  cortex and a fine needle aspiration was performed on the same day and is  pending.    I had a long discussion with ***** and the friend that accompanied her  to her visit.  We spoke for approximately 60 minutes about her treatment  options.  I had recommended that she consider pursuing neoadjuvant  hormone therapy to try and shrink this tumor before approaching it with  surgery and that this would give us a better idea of the hormone  responsiveness of this very large lobular cancer.  I also discussed with  her the hormone receptors and how they can indicate to us that these  tumors will be very sensitive to hormone therapy.    We talked about the availability of a randomized phase II clinical trial  that randomizes patients to the aromatase inhibitor letrozole, with or  without bevacizumab, the antiangiogenic antibody.  The main 
 side effect  of the antibody for Ms. ***** would be hypertension.  We discussed this  at some length and she was extremely hesitant to consider enrolling in a  clinical trial and after receiving additional information and thinking  about it over the weekend, reiterated the fact that although she  appreciated the information that we provided to her, she was not  interested in participating in a clinical trial.  We talked abut  neoadjuvant hormone therapy versus taking an adjuvant approach.  She  clearly has surgically accessible disease if she approaches this with a  mastectomy.  Subsequently, she has responded to us that she would most  like to pursue a mastectomy up front for this cancer and not pursue  neoadjuvant treatment approach.  Therefore, I have referred Ms. *****  back to *****. ***** for consideration for surgery and then I will meet  with her after surgery to discuss adjuvant treatment options.    Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in the care of this  lovely woman.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions  regarding my evaluation or recommendations and we will make a final  decision regarding her adjuvant therapy following receipt of her  pathology from her upcoming surgery.    *****,    ***** *****. *****, M.D.  CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE  UCSF COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER  ***** ***** ***** BREAST CARE CENTER    CARBON COPIES:              ***** ***** *****, MD                              ***** ***** *****,***** *****                              ***** ***** *****                                *****-***** *****, MD                              ***** *****          DICTATED BY:                 ***** *****. *****, MD *****                                       ____________________________    ATTENDING PHYSICIAN         ***** *****. *****, MD *****                                   Electronically Signed by                               ***** *****. *****, MD *****/*****/***** *****:***** *****

She has a diagnosis of locally advanced and unresectable adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas.    She presented with abdominal pain and weight loss as early as November and December 2016. Eventually, she went to the emergency room in February 2017 and received pain medications and a workup was initiated. CT scan of the abdomen done on 03/08/2017 showed a mass measuring 3.6 x 4.3 x 4.3 cm. Vascular involvement was not described. An 11 mm lesion in the liver was seen but not characterized or biopsied. EUS done on February 21 showed a mass in the uncinate process and involvement of the SMA. FNA of the mass revealed an adenocarcinoma.    She was initially started on treatment with gemcitabine and Abraxane but had demonstrated radiographic progression on 06/14/2017.

ASSESSMENT / PLAN:  1. Localized adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, on therapy with uncertain disease control  Patient is now s/p 2 cycles of FOLFIRINOX. She presents for C3 today but labs are worrisome for disease progression, biliary obstruction, or ascending cholangitis: T bili 7.4, Alk Phos 493, AST 357, ALT 387    Given that her most recent CT was performed almost 3 months ago (outside CT from 06/14/17) plus today's evidence of hyperbilirubinemia, I have recommended that we postpone today's infusion and have her undergo urgent imaging to rule out biliary ductal dilatation versus disease progression in the liver. ED precautions were reviewed with patient and her daughter. As she may be at risk for cholangitis, she was advised to present to local ED ASAP if she develops fevers/chills. Furthermore, as she presents with daily emesis, which could indicate partial small bowel obstruction, she was also advised to go to ED if she is unable to tolerate any PO intake.     2. Bilateral LE edema  Will have pt undergo bilateral US today to r/o DVT.     3. Multiple symptoms  Encouraged referral to SMS to help with management of her pain, fatigue, and anorexia. Pt agrees to this consultation.     I spent a total of 40 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 40 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the diagnosis, the treatment plan, the prognosis and symptoms    ***** *****, NP    ADDENDUM:   Today's CT scan indicates the 
 following:  1.  In comparison to 06/14/2017, interval increase in size of ill-defined pancreatic head/uncinate process mass, resulting in obstruction of the biliary system distally with proximal intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. Increased pancreatic ductal dilatation.    2.  Increased distention of the stomach with narrowing of the third portion of duodenum, likely due to mass effect from adjacent pancreatic mass, concerning for developing or partial obstruction.    An urgent referral to GI for an ERCP was placed.     Pt was also called and informed of these findings. ED precautions were reviewed.     Lower extremity US did not identify any DVTs.    ***** *****, NP

Genomics  Pending STRATA    Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 52 y.o. male with newly diagnosed metastatic pancreatic cancer.    We discussed the following at today's visit:  I reviewed his imaging, pathology, and staging studies to date, explaining why the mainstay of treatment should consist of systemic therapy (rather than locoregional approaches, such as surgery or radiation), with the goal of achieving as deep and durable a remission as possible, hopefully translating into significant prolongation of life, but that treatment was not expected to be curative.      There are several possible chemotherapy options for metastatic pancreatic cancer, with the choice of therapy depending on a patient's age, performance status, co-morbid conditions, and personal preference. The two current gold standards for front-line treatment, based on phase III data, include FOLFIRINOX (biweekly infusional 5-FU, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) and the combination of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel. Given his age and performance status, FOLFIRINOX is a reasonable first choice standard of care option.    I also discussed potential clinical trials, notably our ongoing *****#*****: Precision Promise Platform Trial For Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer. Prior to this appointment, he reviewed the sample ICF for this study.      Today, he provided consent to proceed with screening procedures:  The UCSF Experimental Subjects Bill of rights has been 
 reviewed with the patient prior to signing the consent form and a copy has been given to the patient.  Alternative treatment to the patient's disease in lieu of clinical trial participation has been discussed with the patient.  Possible risks and possible side effects of participation in this clinical trial have been discussed.  The patient has been given opportunity to ask questions.  The patient has acknowledged that his/her questions were satisfactorily answered.  The requirement for the use of birth control while participating in this clinical trial was discussed.  The financial responsibilities while participating in this clinical trial were reviewed.  The patient has been given a copy of the signed consent form and signed HIPAA Authorization form.  A  Copy of the prohibited medication list has been reviewed with the  Patient.

train_3	0	"HPI:  ***** ***** is a 36 y.o. female with a recently diagnosed hormone receptor positive/HER2 negative node positive right breast cancer. She is scheduled to proceed to surgery on 11/05/17 and is here to discuss treatment options and recent imaging findings.    ***** underwent a mammogram at an outside facility (*****) on 09/24/17 which showed an 1.8 cm irregular hyperdense mass in the right breast. There was no mammographic evidence of malignancy in left breast. US revealed a 1.7 cm irregular hypoechoic mass in the 11:00 position along with 2 prominent axillary LNs. US guided core biopsy of the breast on 09/30/17 revealed invasive ductal carcinoma (ER+ (80-90%), PR+ (80-90%), HER2 by IHC & FISH negative;  Ki67% 20-30%) Histologic grading was not reported.     She sought a surgical opinion at ***** and saw Dr. ***** on 10/02/17. An MRI of breast performed on 10/03/17 at the ***** showed a 2.2 cm mass in the upper central right breast and a 0.4 cm anterior satellite lesion. There were also findings suspicious for additional ductal disease, disease within the nipple and prominent right axillary LNs.    There was some delay in the outside MRI becoming available for Dr. *****'s review but eventually the enlarged lymph nodes were noted to be suspicious and an axillary LN biopsy was scheduled. In the meantime, the patient was seen by Dr. ***** in ***** ***** and the patient underwent an egg harvest. This resulted in only 3 fertilized embryos, so ***** has interest in trying another egg harvest at some point.    ***** underwent an axillary FNA on 10/28/17 and the node was positive for metastatic cancer. PET/CT performed on 10/31/17 revealed a hypermetabolic right breast mass (2.1 x 1.6 cm) and an enlarged right axillary lymph node. There were other subcentimeter, asymmetric right subpectoral lymph nodes with low-level uptake. There was also a hyperdense 0.7 cm falx lesion that could be a partially calcified 
 falcine meningioma or dural metastasis. She underwent an MRI brain today to exclude a dural metastasis. The MRI showed a 0.5 cm right parafalcine dural-based mass most likely a meningioma. I spoke with the radiologist to find out if this lesion was amenable to biopsy and the neuroradiologist thought a biopsy could be difficult and morbid and their level of suspicion for this lesion being metastatic disease is low.    She is scheduled to undergo a partial mastectomy and ALND with Dr ***** on 11/05/17. She is here for planning of subsequent steps of treatment and to discuss her treatment options. She is also concerned about whether she needs to take time off from work during her treatment especially during chemotherapy.

Breast cancer: ***** is scheduled to undergo surgery on 11/05/17. We reviewed her imaging and pathology reports to date. I explained that because of her young age and lymph node involvement, it is very likely that she will need adjuvant chemotherapy in addition to hormonal therapy. However, because her cancer is hormone receptor positive or locally advanced tumors  and we are not certain of the tumor size and number of lymph nodes involved, it is not certain that she needs an anthracycline containing regimen. Although we often consider neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with node positive or locally advanced breast cancers, Dr. ***** feels he can offer ***** breast conserving surgery without neoadjuvant treatment and we can then know more definitively the tumor size, extent of nodal involvement and possibly a Mammaprint on her tumor.  I explained to her that the final decision about chemotherapy can be made after surgery when we however we discussed several options and trials which may be appropriate for her.     I reviewed the meaning of the Mammaprint result and described the data published by Vant Veer in the NEJM in 2002 and the validation data published in the JNCI in 2006. I explained additional validation data for use of Mammaprint as both a prognostic and predictive tool. I also explained the 
 published results form the Mindact trial which demonstrated that patients who have clinical higher risk cancers based on traditional measures including tumor size, grade and lymph node status, but whose tumors have a Mammaprint Low Risk profile have an excellent prognosis at 5 years even in the absence of chemotherapy, and chemotherapy offers very little benefit for these patients.     We briefly discussed choice of chemotherapy and reviewed the data from the ""Anthracyclines in Early Breast Cancer: The ABC Trials-USOR 06-090, NSABP B-46-I/USOR 07132, and NSABP B-49 (NRG Oncology)"" metaanalysis published by Joanne Blum in JCO in April 2017.   In these three adjuvant trials, women were randomized TC for six cycles or to a standard TaxAC regimen. The primary end point was invasive disease-free survival (IDFS). A hazard ratio (HR) that exceeded 1.18 for TC6 versus TaxAC was predefined as inferiority for TC6. With a median follow up of 3.3 years, the HR for TC6 versus TaxAC was 1.202 which triggered early reporting for futility and supported that TC x 6 was not non-inferior to TaxAC. The 4-year IDFS was 88.2% for TC6 and was 90.7% for TaxAC (P = .04). However, upon review of particular subsets including patients who were ER+ and node negative, there was no statistically significant difference in outcomes between TC x 6 and TaxAC, and in the ER+ patients with 1-3 positive lymph nodes, the difference in IDFS was very modest. Therefore, if ***** is Mammaprint High Risk and needs chemotherapy but has fewer than 3 positive nodes, she may not gain substantial benefit from an anthracycline containing regimen.    We discussed the toxicities associated with Taxotere and Cytoxan including increased risk of infection, hair loss, fatigue, and possibility of ovarian failure. I explained that taxanes are associated with development of neuropathy which is most often transient and rarely *****. I also explained that we are 
 proponents of scalp cooling including the Dignicap and Penguin Cold Cap which can help preserve hair during chemotherapy.    We briefly discussed participation in clinical trial trials of CDK 4/6 inhibitors such as the PALLAS and JPBE.     Lastly, ***** and her husband asked about when she would begin treatment with hormonal therapy. I explained that she would start this after radiation and we will discuss selection of hormonal therapy and side effects at a later visit.    2. Fertility preservation: ***** is interested in another round of egg harvesting since she has only three fertilized embryos. She is open to surrogacy if needed in the future and will be eligible for financial support from her employer. I am supportive of her decision to undergo egg harvest for the second time after completion of surgery.     FU after surgery.    I have reviewed and updated the patient's past medical history, medications, allergies, family and social histories. I spent a total of 60 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 40 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding lifestyle modification, symptoms and therapeutic options. Patient expresses understanding and agrees with the plan.

His oncologic history is reviewed here:     HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ***** ***** is a 62 year old male,   History notable for type II DM, w  03/19/17 he presented to ***** with 3 weeks of painless jaundice and acholic stools. He was found to have transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia, and a mass at the pancreatic head.   03/26/17, the patient had an endoscopic US, stent placement in the stricture at the CBD, and a biopsy/brushings taken.   ""-A mass was identified in the pancreatic head. Fine needle aspiration performed with atypical cells seen but otherwise official results pending.  -Hyperechoic material consistent with sludge was visualized ***** in the gallbladder.  -There was no evidence of significant pathology in the visualized portion of the liver.""  03/30/17, the stent was replaced in the setting of upward trending total bilirubin. Biopsy from 03/26/17 revealed adenocarcinoma, and a CT abd/pelvis and chest shows stage 3 local advancement without evidence of distant metastasis.   04/13/17: ***** ***** Surgical Eval.    04/20/17: ***** surgical eval.     06/03/17: C1D1 neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX   10/20/17: CT scan: Stable, no e/o progression   11/05/17: Cycle 12 FOLFIRINOX (Final cycle)  01/25/18: Whipple with Dr. *****. Completed pancreatico-duodenectomy with pancreatico-jejunostomy, and per op report, mass was adherent to the portal vein. Pathology revealed 4.6cm pancreatic head adenocarcinoma with +PNI, +SM at the SMA margin with 11/46 lymph nodes positive. His postoperative course was complicated by a wound infection in his left neck incision and he was discharged to a SNF where he required 1 month of rehab and was discharged home on 03/24/18.  04/15/18: 
 CT CAP reports ill defined stranding in surgical resection bed consistent with recurrence or post-surgical changes with significant portal vein anastamosis narrowing. No evidence of metastatic disease.  04/21/18: Consultation with Dr. *****. He presented TB's recommendations: Given patient's high risk of recurrence with + margins at the SMA and many LNs involved, it was recommended that patient receive XRT and then systemic therapy   05/04/18: Consultation with Dr. *****. Recommendations: Repeat PET/CT prior to start of radiotherapy. IMRT auth submitted, anticipate 28 fractions - plan for CT sim in ~2 weeks after resolution of C dificile infection.

Adenocarcinoma was not  present on the slides evaluated for frozen section diagnosis.     Uncinate (Retroperitoneal) Margin: For the pancreaticoduodenectomy  specimen (part F), invasive carcinoma is less than 0.1 cm from  cauterized margin on slide F5.   Bile Duct Margin: Negative for invasive carcinoma and high-grade  dysplasia, invasive carcinoma is 0.5 cm from margin.  Portal Vein Margin: Both the superior and inferior portal vein margins  are negative for invasive carcinoma. Invasive carcinoma is 0.8 cm from  the superior portal vein margin and 2.3 cm from the inferior portal vein  margin.   Pancreatic Neck Margin: For the pancreaticoduodenectomy specimen (part  F), the pancreatic neck margin is positive for invasive adenocarcinoma  on slide F1. For the distal pancreatectomy specimen (part E), a focus of  invasive carcinoma is present at the proximal pancreatic margin.  Correlation with operative findings is recommended to determine if  either of these represents a true surgical margin.   Proximal Intestinal Margin: Negative for invasive carcinoma, invasive  carcinoma is 6 cm from the margin.  Distal Intestinal Margin (Distal Duodenal or Jejunal): Negative for  invasive carcinoma, invasive carcinoma is 9 cm from the margin.  - Posterior pancreatic surface: Negative, invasive carcinoma is 0.1 cm  from this surface on slide F13.   - Anterior pancreatic surface: Negative, invasive carcinoma is 1 cm  from this surface on slide F12.  - Treatment Effect: Residual tumor on slides E1, F1, F4, F5, and  F8-F16.    Evans grading system (grade I-IV): 
 Grade I, little (<10%) or no  tumor cell destruction.     Modified Ryan scheme for tumor regression (score 0-3): Score 3,  poor or no response (extensive residual cancer with no evident tumor  regression).  - Regional Lymph Nodes: Positive.    Total number of positive nodes: 11.    Nodes involved by direct extension: 4.     Total number of nodes examined: 46.  - Other Pathologic Findings: Chronic pancreatitis, extensive;  pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, high grade.   AJCC 8th Edition Pathologic Stage: ypT3N2.    Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the status of DNA  mismatch repair protein expression on block F11. The results in the  tumor cell nuclei are:  MLH1 expression: Present.   PMS2 expression: Present.  MSH2 expression: Present.  MSH6 expression: Present.  05/20/18: Ascites cell block interpreted as benign, and negative for KRAS mutations in exons 2, 3 and 4.     Assessment    Impression: 64 y.o. male with resected PDAC, pT2N3, + superior mesenteric artery margin.    Plan:  1. Resected Pancreatic Cancer.  Positive margins and high risk for recurrence now with rising markers.   Recheck Ca19-9 this week.   CT in 2 weeks  RTC with me post-above.     2. Nutrition   - continue creon  3.

train_6	1	"This is an independent visit    ATTENDING: ***** *****, MD     PATIENT IDENTIFICATION: Mr. ***** is a 71 y.o. male who returns to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of his diagnosis of Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, status post resection, now with new metastatic disease.    ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:   He presented with abdominal discomfort and biliary ductal obstruction. In March 2018, and an ERCP and stent was placed.    04/01/2018: Underwent a Whipple for pancreatic adenocarcinoma in *****. Experienced postoperative complications of internal bleeding that required an additional laparotomy. He had direct invasion of the tumor into the duodenum and 6 of 25 lymph nodes were positive. Postoperatively, he also had a small bowel obstruction which was relieved by nasogastric suction. He had a port placed but this was removed as it became infected and he also experienced sepsis with klebsiella. This was treated with Cipro.    05/25/18: New baseline CT CAP reveals evidence of new liver metastases    06/05/18: C1D1 FOLFIRINOX.  CA 19-9 was 17,090.  06/12/18: Presented to UCSF ED with fever of 38.3 C. CT was negative for any acute findings, but did reveal worsening metastatic disease to liver. CXR clear and UA negative.   06/21/18: C2D1 FOLFIRINOX   07/05/18: C3D1. CA 19-9 was 21,247.  07/19/18: C4D1  08/01/18: CT CAP reveals decrease in size of hepatic mets, interval increase in pancreatic ductal dilatation.   08/02/18: C5D1.

His labs and PS are acceptable and he agrees to proceed with C2D1 Gem/Abrax. We discussed the possibility of having to reduce his Abraxane dose in the future if his peripheral neuropathy worsens. Given that he has grade 1 neuropathy at this point, no dose modifications are indicated. His labs and PS are acceptable and he will proceed with C2D1 today. CT scan due after he completes cycle 2.     #Nausea/vomiting: Improved  - 
 Likely June 24 chemotherapy   - Premed with Aloxi & Emend.   - On day 3 patient will apply granisetron patch 3.1 mg/24 hours, and take compazine PRN.   - IV hydration on additional days 3 & 11 PRN   - Patient will also continue to use cannabis product.     #pancreatic enzyme insufficiency   - Continue Creon 2 tab/meal and 1 tab/snacks    #SPINK1 gene mutation: SPINK1: c.101A>G  - Patient is a carrier, but does not have SPINK1-related risks that are due to having TWO mutations. His family needs to be screened for SPINK1 which is classically a gene and some familial pancreatitis but also leads to pancreatic cancer.    #R UE tremor & bilateral foot drop L>R: resolved  - EMG on 09/15/18 to evaluate foot drop revealed the following:   ""evidence for bilateral, predominantly demyelinating peroneal neuropathies across the fibular head...Demyelinating peroneal neuropathies at the fibular head can be seen in patients who frequently cross their legs, particularly after a period of weight loss (as is the case in this patient)""  - Followed by his PCP, Dr. *****.   - Continue to monitor    RETURN TO CLINIC: 2 weeks    As always, the patient was counseled to contact the clinic or the after-hours physician on call for any new symptoms or complications in the interim between now and her follow up visit with me.    I spent a total of 25 minutes face-to-face with the patient and >50% of that time was spent counseling regarding the symptoms, treatment plan, risks and/or therapeutic options for the diagnoses above.    ***** *****, NP

train_7	1	"SUBJECTIVE:    This is a very pleasant 64-year-old woman with a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, extent of disease uncertain. She presented in June 2020 and was thought to have locally advanced disease. She initiated treatment with FOLFIRINOX and after 4 cycles of therapy, her CT scan showed a new liver lesion. This was confirmed with MRI as suspicious for metastasis. If subsequent PET/CT scan did not show that the liver lesions were PET avid.    At that point, in October we initiated gemcitabine and Abraxane. She has now completed six 28 day cycles and is on surveillance. it should be noted that she did have an opinion at ***** *****. Their feeling was that while some of her liver lesions were hemangiomas there was a lesion in segment 7 that was consistent with a liver metastasis.    Earlier this week, she had an EGD and ERCP following complaints of persistent nausea. She was found to have tumor ingrowth and her stent along with a biliary stone and blood clots. These were removed and a covered metal stent was deployed within the existing stent.    She does not express CA-19-9.    She feels much better after the stent revision. She has a good energy level. She can walk up to 4 miles a day. She does complain of brain fog which she attributes to her chemotherapy. The numbness and tingling in her fingers and hands have resolved. She still has some numbness and tingling in her feet. It does not affect her gait. Her appetite is improving following the ERCP. She has a bowel movement every 3 days or so with the help of fiber and MiraLAX. Her hair is growing back.      MED:  Medications the patient states to be taking prior to today's encounter.   Medication Sig    buPROPion (WELLBUTRIN SR) 100 mg 12 hr tablet Take 100 mg by mouth daily    estradiol twice weekly patch 0.05 mg/24 hr estradiol 0.05 mg/24 hr semiweekly transdermal patch    LORazepam (ATIVAN) 1 mg tablet Take 1 mg by mouth every 8 (eight) hours

Endoscope advanced to the duodenum with subsequent wire cannulization of the metallic common bile duct stent. Wire was passed beyond the stent into the intrahepatic bile ducts with subsequent cholangiogram demonstrating irregular moderate intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation with filling defects related to sludge or stones. Irregular narrowing of the common bile duct in the region of the stent with subsequent balloon sweeping related to known history of pancreatic cancer. Sweeping of the right intrahepatic bile duct was also performed. A likely second metal stent was deployed within the existing metallic common bile duct stent.

train_9	0	"Subjective:       Patient ID: ***** ***** ***** ***** 51 y.o. female.    HPI  ***** ***** is a 51 y.o. female with a biopsy proven left breast DCIS comes to our clinic today for a discussion of potential adjuvant anti-hormonal therapy. Ms. ***** presented on 12/05/2016 for routine screening mammography at which time indeterminate calcifications in the lower inner left breast were identified and a recommendation of additional imaging was made. On 12/11/2016 left breast diagnostic mammography was performed and showed a mammogram that was extremely dense with 3 mm group of amorphous punctate round calcifications in the left inner breast middle depth visible only on the cc view and these were new since 2011 and were deemed suspicious and a stereotactic core biopsy was recommended and performed on 12/27/2016. The pathology from this is appended below:    Left breast December 28/  FINAL PATHOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS  Left breast, stereotactic core needle biopsy:  1. Ductal carcinoma in situ, intermediate nuclear grade, cribriform and  micropapillary patterns, with focal necrosis; see comment.  2. Microcalcifications in association with ductal carcinoma in situ.  >90% estrogen receptor positive, Progesterone receptor pending.      Based on this finding a lumpectomy was recommended and performed on 01/29/2017 the pathology of which is appended below:  Laterality: Left.  - Tumor site: Lower inner quadrant.    - Position: 7 o'clock.  - Invasive tumor type: None.  - Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS): Present.  - DCIS nuclear grade: Intermediate.  - DCIS architectural patterns: Solid and cribriform.  - Necrosis in DCIS: None.  - Ductal carcinoma in situ size: DCIS present in 5 contiguous slices  (December 26), spanning 1.8 cm.  - Microcalcifications: None.  - Resection margins for DCIS:   For Part A:     - Posterior margin: Positive (tumor is at ink, on slide A8).  Additional margin submitted in part B is <0.1 from the new margin.    - 
 Anterior medial margin: Negative (tumor is <0.1 cm away, on  slide A7, A9, A10).    - Anterior lateral margin: Negative (tumor is >1 cm away, on slide  A6).    - Superior margin: Negative (tumor is >1 cm away).    - Inferior margin: Negative (tumor is >1 cm away).    Additional margin was submitted separately (Part B) and shows DCIS <0.1  cm from the new margin (black ink). Level sections were performed on  parts *****-***** to confirm the above diagnosis.    - Lobular carcinoma in situ: None.  - Non-neoplastic breast: Apocrine metaplasia, usual ductal hyperplasia,  fat necrosis.  - Lymph node status: N/A.  - AJCC/UICC stage: pTisNx.    - Tumor biomarker (ER/PR) status was positive.    At this time Ms. ***** is at her baseline. Her left breast is still somewhat sore subsequent to her surgery but she is in no severe pain. His weight is continuing to menstruate although she is having significant hot flashes and night sweats which have been going on about 9 months and perhaps are worsening. She has continues to have chronic low back pain but this is unchanged for her.

 Judgment and thought content normal.           Assessment:       I had a detailed discussion with Mrs. ***** about the nature of ductal carcinoma in situ and our general approach to treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ including the use of surgery and/or radiation to remove the growth from the breast so that it does not recur locally and the use of adjuvant systemic anti-hormonal therapy which also would help to decrease the risk of local recurrence. In addition I spoke about its primary preventative effect as well with the decrease in new breast cancer events of 50%. Since Ms. ***** is continuing to menstruate, although because she is having symptomatology of hot flashes and night sweats she may be in the perimenopausal period, I suggested that the drug of choice would be a tamoxifen if she were to contemplate anti-hormonal therapy. We went the mechanism of tamoxifen with both its pro-as well as antiestrogenic effects and its various side effects including exacerbation of postmenopausal symptomatology increases in hot flashes and night sweats, increase in clotting risk with increased risk of deep venous thrombosis as well as pulmonary embolus and stroke, and the increased risk of endometrial carcinoma. Ms. ***** seemed to understand all of these issues fairly well. She is currently pending an appointment with ***** ***** to assess whether or not she will be a candidate for radiation therapy at this time. I will send a prescription for tamoxifen into her pharmacy but have told her to hold off on taking this drug until after she has her radiation oncology assessment.      Plan:       return to clinic 4-6 weeks after beginning tamoxifen to assess therapy tolerance

train_10	0	"ID: ***** ***** is a 31 y.o. premenopausal female patient with a history of a Stage III HR+/HER2- IDC of the left breast, now with biopsy proven recurrence, now presenting in consultation to discuss treatment options and to establish care.     Date of Service: 01/28/19    HPI: The patient was originally diagnosed with breast cancer in late 2013 after palpating a mass in her left breast while breastfeeding.  Imaging in August 2013 demonstrated a hypoechoic focus in her left breast and subsequent evaluations led to a diagnosis of a HR+/HER2- IDC of the left breast. She was treated with bilateral skin-sparing mastectomy and started on adjuvant ddAC, but stopped after 3 cycles due to intolerance of side-effects including several hospitalizations.  She eventually started leuprolide plus exemestane, later switching to leuprolide plus tamoxifen, but this therapy was d/c after 1-2 years in the context of loss of her health insurance coverage. In late June 2019, she felt a left breast mass and a subsequent US and biopsy demonstrated a HR+/HER2- IDC of the left breast. Her diagnostic history and evaluation are as listed below:     08/03/13 Bilateral breast US: Irregular somewhat scalloped appearning hypoechoic focus (2 cm) in left axillary tail  US-guided core biopsy of 2.2 cm palpable nodule in upper-outer left breast: IDC with micropapillary features  ER+ (H score 290, or >75%), PR+ (H score 290, or >75%), HER2- (FISH ratio 1.0), Ki-67 5%     08/10/13 Bilateral diagnostic digital mammogram: Extensive, segmentally distributed, clustered calcifications (13 cm in extent) in upper outer quadrant of left breast; associated focal, poorly defined, dense and irregular mass (2.3 cm) present superolaterally in upper outer quadrant of left breast  Left axillary US: Two adjacent LN demonstrating focal, nodular thickening of parenchyma (1.8 cm and 1.9 cm)  US-guided left axillary LN biopsy: Metastatic carcinoma with ER+ (H score 290, or 
 >75%), PR+ (H score 290, or >75%), HER2- (FISH ratio 1.02), Ki-67 5%     09/08/13 Bilateral breast skin-sparing mastectomy + left axillary SLNB with DIEP: left breast - 8.0 cm grade 2 IDC micropapillary type, LVI present, final margins clear; intermediate nuclear grade DCIS present, 7/16 LN+ (1.2 cm with extracapsular extension) pT3pN2; right breast - no carcinoma    09/17/13 Whole body bone scan: Usual symmetric radiotracer uptake in axial and appendicular skeleton is observed, no findings suggesting metastatic disease     09/18/13 CT CAP: no evidence of metastases     11/12/13 started dose dense Adriamycin/cytoxan - decided to stop active treatment after 3 cycles.  Had severe nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills as well as diffused body pains - per pt.     12/18/13 CT CAP: Soft tissue swelling of bilateral breast reconstructions without obvious loculated fluid collection in visualized lower breast reconstructions, region of abdominoplasty wound in midline there is a sinus tract extending to open would on skin filled with fluid (4.1 x 2.2 x 1.3 cm), induration and soft tissue swelling about this region   Bilateral breast US: Moderate bilateral subcutaneous soft tissue swelling; no evidence of loculated fluid collection     03/10/15 CT CAP: increased size of mildly hypermetabolic right deep pectoral and axillary LN (1.4 cm short axis MAX suv 4.9), mildly hypermetabolic right axillary LN (1.1 short axis MAX suv 4.9) are larger, area of right outer lower breast central fat density (4.3 x 4.9 cm SUV max 4.1) most compatible with fat necrosis, similar area is seen in upper and lower medial left breast    03/21/15 US-guided right breast LN biopsy: Benign axillary node hyperplasia    2015 Started on 4 week Lupron x 1-2 years plus exemestane and latera tamoxifen by Dr. *****    08/18/15 CT chest: No pulmonary embolus or other acute abnormality     09/13/15 Bilateral US complete: Previously examined right axillary LN decreased in size 
 with decreased cortical thickening, consistent with benign path results     Recurrence     June 2018 Patient noticed a left breast lump increasing in size and darkening of the associated skin      10/26/18 Left breast US (at *****):  Irregular lobulated solid mass (3.1 x 1.8 x 3.0 cm) with a satellite mass (1.2 x 0.9 x 0.9 cm) at 1:00 position, 7 cm from nipple; mass appearing to involve overlying skin  US-guided biopsy of mass at 2:00 position of left breast: grade 2 IDC ER+(>95%), PR+(>95%), HER2- (IHC 1+) Ki-67 30%-40%    01/27/19 PET/CT: Left breast subcutaneous mass (2.1 x 3.2 cm SUV 8.4), left axillary node (1.3 x 1.4 cm SUV 6.0), left level 5B LN conglomerate (1.8 x 2.5 cm SUV 9.23), left internal mammary LN (1.2 x 2.0 cm SUV 6.8); left axillary, left supraclavicular, left level VB and left internal mammary hypermetabolic LAD are suspicious for metastatic diease; hypermetabolic subcutaneous masses overlying the left breast     The patient's gynecologic history is as follows.  She underwent menarche at 11 years of age.  She took OCP for less than a year.  She is G5P3; had two abortions. Her children are 12, 10 and 7 yo.  Her first pregnancy was at 19 years of age.  She has irregular menstrual periods.     She presents to clinic with her husband who has multiple medical problems.  She is currently unemployed - prior to her diagnosis she was involved in a home health agency.     States she was prescribed gapabentin for numbness and a deep sharp pain of her elbow that shoots up/down her entire left arm. The medication helps ""take the edge off"" - takes it as needed (~2x a week) when the pain is severe. Currently the pain is a 5-6/10.    Additionally, she has chronic back pain and occasional aches of her bilateral knees and ankles.     She believes that she tolerated Lupron injections well - was happy that her menstrual periods stopped during that time. Had to stop the Lupron injections once her insurance policy changed. 
 She also recalls taking tamoxifen and exemestane and experiencing nausea and body pain.     States that her way to cope with her disease has been through getting tattoos.    She feels that the mass on her left breast is growing rapidly. She has noticed a some discoloration above the mass as well as a lump on her left neck area - initially assumed that this was an injury from straining her neck.     Her weight is stable. Admits to having a sweet tooth. She has been drinking soursop fruit juice.

Assessment and Recommendations:  31 y.o. premenopausal female patient with a history of a Stage III (T3N2) HR+/HER2- grade 2 IDC with micropapillary features of the left breast, now with a locally advanced, unresectable recurrence (possibly considered metastatic in context of a level Vb LN), who requires additional evaluation prior to starting systemic therapy.    I discussed with ***** and her husband in great detail the natural history and treatment of locally advanced, and recurrent HR+/HER2- breast cancer.  We reviewed the pathology report and discussed the multidisciplinary approach to breast cancer treatment.  Her PET/CT demonstrated uptake in a level Vb lymph nodes, which is concerning for metastatic disease; regardless, her disease is currently unresectable and she needs to start systemic therapy.  We will get an FNA through the palpable FNA clinic as soon as possible to confirm diagnosis.     I explained that if she has HR+/HER2- MBC, it is not curable, but 
 treatable, with primary goals of prolongation of life, while maintaining a good quality of life without excessive toxicities.  I stated that the use of chemotherapy upfront does not lead to better outcomes, and we therefore prefer to avoid chemotherapy as long as possible to limit toxicity.      I stated that the standard first line endocrine-based treatment for premenopausal patients with HR+ MBC is ovarian suppression plus an aromatase inhibitor and more recently, the addition of a CDK 4/6 inhibitor.     We will plan to start her on OS as soon as possible and then start an AI.  She has had poor tolerance of therapy in the past and we will need to take this process of adding on additional medications slowly.        Recommendations in Brief:  - plan to FNA the mass on left lateral anterior neck  - plan to start goserelin, followed by AI  - encouraged to reach out with any concerns    The patient will return to clinic two weeks after her first OS.     I spent a total of 70 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 65 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the diagnosis, the treatment plan, the prognosis, medication risks, lifestyle modification, the risks and benefits of surgery, symptoms and therapeutic options.    *****, ***** *****, am acting as a scribe for services provided by ***** ***** *****, MD on *****/*****/***** *****:***** PM.

As you  know, she is a 73-year-old woman who initially had a right breast mass  removed in February 1994 with an axillary lymph node dissection.  That  surgical procedure revealed a 1 cm, grade 1, infiltrating ductal  carcinoma with clear surgical margins and 21 axillary lymph nodes were  negative for metastatic carcinoma.  S-phase was low at 3.6%.  The tumor  was found to be estrogen-receptor positive and progesterone-receptor  negative.  She received interstitial radiation, which comprised 4500  centigray over a 3 cm diameter.  She received tamoxifen from 1994 to  1996 and stopped due to concern regarding side effects.  At that time,  she was seeing Dr. ***** *****.  In January 1996, a node was  palpated in the left supraclavicular area.  A fine-needle aspiration was  performed and was unremarkable.  A dense area at the 12 o'clock position  in her right breast was tender in 2006 and was felt to be postsurgical  scarring.  This was noted to increase over time in size and density.  Initially, the workup included a PET scan in November 2005 
 that  revealed a 5 x 7 cm area of density consistent with inflammation.  It is  not clear whether she had a CT-guided biopsy at that time or not.  In  February 2008, she noted discomfort in the right anterior chest wall and  again thought that this area might be slightly larger.  She also thought  that she had a new right breast mass.  Workup of that breast mass was  unremarkable.  However, a breast MRI was performed on March 24 that  revealed a bulky irregular mass in the right 8 o'clock posterior breast,  which measured 1.9 x 1.5 cm with heterogenous enhancement.  Concordant  with an area of metabolic uptake on PET/CT scan, there was a second mass  abutting the pectoralis muscle with similar enhancing characteristics  measuring 1.7 x 1.2 cm.  A third nodule was seen along the right lateral  breast measuring 0.6 x 0.3 cm.  The left breast was unremarkable.  The  PET/CT scan had been performed on 02/22/2008, and was compared to a  PET/CT scan in December 2005.  This revealed a 2 cm right axillary  lymph node and a 1.4 cm hypermetabolic soft tissue nodule with an SUV of  4.1 in the right mid anterior chest wall deep in the subcutaneous fat.  A second right axillary lymph node was also noted, which was  hypermetabolic.  Subsequently, Dr. ***** performed a fine-needle  aspiration of the upper medial area, which was positive for carcinoma,  and a core biopsy of the right breast mass, which revealed a reactive  lymph node.    The patient states that at that time there was much discussion about  surgical management of this tumor.  It was felt that she would require  muscle resection and the patient initially decided to move forward with  this, but then did not have the surgery.  A follow-up PET/CT scan in  August 2008 revealed a 2 cm subcutaneous hypermetabolic focus in  the right upper parasternal level with an SUV of 7.4 and an ill-defined  1.3 cm hypermetabolic focus in the posterior segment of the medial 
 right  lobe of the liver with an SUV of 4.8.  These findings were felt to be  consistent with metastatic disease.  In November 2008, a follow-up  PET/CT scan was performed.  This revealed a soft tissue mass inferior  and anterior to the right aspect of the manubrium sternum, measuring 1.9  x 1.5 cm, slightly larger than the scan in August and diffuse  heterogenous uptake throughout the liver without the focal lesions seen  in August.  Apparently a right axillary lymph node biopsy had been  performed in February 2008 and revealed benign pathology.  In any case,  she comes here today for a discussion of potential treatment options  having as yet not pursued treatment for her locally recurrent and  unresectable disease.    PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Her past medical history is remarkable for  osteoarthritis in the left hand, trace emphysema by x-ray,  diverticulosis on colonoscopy, osteopenia, and a benign thyroid nodule.  Her most significant symptom is neuropathy of the right hand associated  with a right brachial plexopathy and loss of muscle mass in her  intrinsic hand muscles.  This history dates back to 1987 when a scalene  rib was removed on the right due to neuropathy thought to be causing a  right thoracic outlet syndrome.  Since that time, her right hand has  been weak.  It occasionally freezes on her and overall her symptoms have  gotten worse with increasing loss of muscle mass.  She has a mild distal  polyneuropathy with tingling and numbness in the feet and hands and  milder in the left hand.  This is improved some with CoQ10.  She notes  that she has short-term memory loss.  She was seen in ***** and Aging  Clinic in January 2008 and was diagnosed with symptoms consistent  with aging and depression.  A right frontal CVA was discovered on  imaging, which is thought embolic, and was very small in 2003.  She has  a history of ocular migraines associated with opaque vision the last 20  minutes.  
 They are episodic, but come in batches.  She has been to the  emergency room approximately five times for dizziness and  lightheadedness.  The last was in 2007.  She started episodic  lightheadedness and dizziness with moving around and falling spells,  which she finds to be disabling.  She has had a thyroid nodule for two  years thought to be benign.  She had surgery on her feet for hammertoes  in the early 1980s and other than being hospitalized for her  pregnancies, she has been hospitalized for migraines in the past as  well.  From her falling spells, she had hairline fractures in her wrists  and elbows about four years ago.  She still has pain in her wrists and  elbows.  She fractured her ankle with a fall more recently requiring a  brace after hitting a hole in the street.    GYN HISTORY: She underwent menarche at age 12.  Her menses stopped in  her mid-50s.  She took oral contraceptives at age 27 for six years and  hormone replacement therapy for 24 months at age 56.  She is G2, P2, and  was 22 at the birth of her first child.    FAMILY HISTORY: She has one maternal aunt with breast cancer at the age  of 70 and she has two maternal cousins with a history of cancer, one  small intestine and one prostate.    SOCIAL HISTORY: She is divorced and lives with her 42-year-old son who  is unemployed.  She worked with the military.  She does not drink  alcohol.  She smoked cigarettes for 75-pack-years stopping more than 12  months ago.    REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: She notes that she has lack of energy and pain in her  right hand.  She has some discomfort associated with the breast mass.  She has pain in her wrists and elbows from where she fractured them.  She is not eating well.  Her appetite has decreased.  She has lost five  pounds over the last few months.  She notes that she has tight breathing  when she has dizziness and this is episodic and it is associated with  panic-like attacks, flushing, and then dizziness.  If 
 she is carrying  something heavy, she cannot go up the stairs without stopping.  She  sleeps well.  She has had fatigue since the time of her radiation in  1994, unable to work, which has led to her retirement.  She feels a  pulling sensation in her anterior chest wall down the center of her  right breast with occasional shooting pain and pain occasionally in her  left elbow, which she was told was tennis elbow.  The rest of her review  of systems is in the history of present illness.    PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL: On physical examination, she is a pleasant woman in no acute  distress who appears to have very good recall.  VITAL SIGNS: Her height is 5'6"", weight is 152 pounds, blood pressure  160/82, pulse 82, respirations 18, and her saturation is 98% on room  air.  SKIN: Her skin reveals no lesions.  HEENT: Her oropharynx is clear.  She is anicteric.  LYMPH NODES: She has no cervical or axillary adenopathy.  There are  soft, mobile nodes in the left supraclavicular space.  LUNGS: Her lungs are clear bilaterally to auscultation and percussion.  CARDIAC: Her cardiac exam is without murmur or gallop.  BREASTS: Her left breast is without masses.  Her right breast reveals a  well-healed incision in the 12 o'clock aspect of her right breast with  some density just below the incision.  She has a 2.5 x 2.5 cm, hard,  fixed mass just lateral to the sternal edge in the left superior chest  wall above her breast.  ABDOMEN: Her abdomen is soft and nontender without hepatosplenomegaly.  EXTREMITIES: Her extremities are without edema.  NEUROLOGIC: Neurologic exam is grossly nonfocal, although I did not  evaluate for brachial plexopathy in her right arm.    IMPRESSION: In summary, this patient is a complicated 73-year-old woman  with locally recurrent, unresectable, hormone-receptor positive breast  cancer, which was initially treated at diagnosis in 1994 with surgery  and interstitial radiation.  She has never taken hormone 
 therapy for her  recurrence, although she was exposed to tamoxifen for a little under two  years back in 1994.  During our discussion, I went over in detail her  treatment options, including hormonal therapy with an aromatase  inhibitor on or off a clinical trial and certainly we would offer her  letrozole with alendronate as indicated for her bone density.  The  patient states that her bone density in February 2008 revealed a T-score  of -2.8 in her spine, which is consistent with osteoporosis, and -1.9 in  her femur consistent with osteopenia.  Therefore, I think it would be  appropriate even without bone mets to start her on zoledronic acid if  she agrees to start on a course with an aromatase inhibitor.  I also  pointed out to her that she is eligible to participate in CALGB 40503,  which would treat her with letrozole and then randomize to receive  bevacizumab or placebo.  In order to further evaluate her candidacy for  additional treatment, I obtained a PET/CT scan, which was performed on  January 16.  This showed increased FDG avidity within a right  parasternal chest wall nodule as well as in a lymph node along the  inferior right axillary chain.  The right parasternal soft tissue nodule  measured 1.9 cm and was intricately involved with the underlying chest  wall.  The lesion was adjacent to a soft tissue density deep to three  surgical clips in the right upper inner breast without FDG avidity  consistent with scar.  There was a right inferior axillary lymph node  measuring 1.9 cm with an SUV of 2 and an adjacent 0.5 cm lymph node.  Compared to the PET/CT scan first done in February 2008, the parasternal  nodule had increased in size, although interestingly the axillary nodes  which have not been proven to be involved with cancer, have decreased in  size.  Her abdomen shows a small, well-demarcated, low-attenuation  lesion in the liver consistent with cyst and her bones reveal no  abnormalities.    In 
 summary, this patient is a 73-year-old woman with a remarkable  history dating back initially to a low-stage cancer in 1994 and now  presenting 14+ years later with a local regional recurrence that is not  resectable and has not yet been treated with hormone therapy due to the  patient's concerns about her treatment options.  I had a long talk with  her today and suggested that she consider treatment with an aromatase  inhibitor either on or off study and that we obtain laboratory studies  as well as PET/CT scan and MRI of her brain because of her falling  spells.  The MRI of her brain showed no evidence of malignancy either in  brain or bone.  She did have a right middle frontal gyrus  encephalomalacia and gliosis consistent with a prior insult.  We  obtained laboratory studies on the day of her visit as well.  These  revealed a normal CBC, creatinine, electrolytes, liver function tests,  and calcium.  Interestingly, a CA27-29 was only 15 and an LDH was normal  as well.  Based on all of this information, it appears that the patient  has a local regional recurrence of a strongly hormone-receptor positive  indolent breast cancer.  No other sites of disease appear to be present.  I think it would be most appropriate to treat this disease with hormone  therapy and follow it closely.  Given the limited radiation field that  she initially had, I think it would be possible to shrink the tumor,  potentially proceed with a surgical resection, and radiate this area in  order to at least approach the possibility of long-term disease control.  On my visit with her on January 09, I started her on zoledronic acid  because of her osteoporosis and need to start her on an aromatase  inhibitor.  She will return to my clinic on January 25 to begin  aromatase inhibitor therapy either alone or on CALGB 4503 randomized to  placebo or bevacizumab.    Thank you very much for allowing me to participate in the care of this  very 
 interesting and lovely woman.

train_12	1	"Ms. ***** is a 69 y.o. female who comes to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center in consultation for her recurrent metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The history was obtained from the patient, along with my review of all her outside records.    History of Present Illness  This pleasant woman with a known germline ATM mutation was initially diagnosed in May 2019 with resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma after presenting with painless jaundice. CT A/P at the time (05/16/19) showed a 2x2.7x2.9 cm pancreatic head mass with associated pancreatic ductal and biliary ductal dilatation. EUS-guided FNA (05/18/19) was consistent with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. She underwent several ERCPs for biliary stent placement and exchange, and ultimately required a percutaneous biliary drain (06/05/19) but w/o complete resolution of her hyperbilirubinemia.     She received 1 cycle of FOLFOX chemotherapy on 06/15/19 (with irinotecan on hold due to elevated bilirubin), and subsequently was taken for a Whipple resection with Dr. ***** ***** (*****) on 07/09/19. Pathology showed a pT2N2, 3.3 cm poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, LVI present, PNI negative, 11/37 lymph nodes, negative margins, MMR intact.     Postoperative CT scan (08/02/19) showed a new soft tissue area inferior to the pancreas, c/w either postoperative changes or recurrent/residual disease. She then started back on chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX on 08/07/19 and completed 11 cycles in total, through 01/09/20.     She underwent incisional hernia repair in June 2020, after which time she noted persistent mid-back pain. Surveillance CT C/A/P (09/10/20) showed enlarging aortocaval and gastrohepatic lymph nodes, new subcentimeter mesenteric lymph nodes, and ongoing hazy attenuation/stranding encasing the peripancreatic vasculature. EUS-guided sampling of an 18 mm lymph node in the gastrohepatic ligament region confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma 
 (09/12/20).    She started on the combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel with an every other week dosing schedule beginning on 09/19/20. Recent restaging CT (10/24/20) after approximately 6 weeks on treatment showed mildly decreased size of intra-abdominal lymph nodes which have become less defined. No new intra-abdominal or intrathoracic disease. New subtle groundglass opacities throughout the lungs in the upper lobes may be related to an infectious/inflammatory etiology.     The patient's present review of systems was reviewed. She denies any pain at present (currently on once-daily long-acting morphine), and reports tolerating current chemotherapy very well, aside from mild fatigue and transient nausea. Appetite is good and weight is stable/improving. She has minimal non-debilitating peripheral sensory neuropathy. Bowel movements are regular and well-formed. She continues to be very active, with an ECOG PS of 0.

Mildly decreased size of intra-abdominal lymph nodes which have become less defined which may be posttreatment related. No new intra-abdominal disease.   3.   No evidence of intrathoracic disease. New subtle groundglass opacities throughout the lungs particularly in the upper lobes may related to infectious/inflammatory or drug related etiologies.      Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Ms. ***** is a 69 y.o. female with a known germline ATM mutation and recurrent metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. She was initially diagnosed in May 2019 with resectable disease and received 1 cycle of FOLFOX prior to Whipple resection (07/09/19) with pT2N2 disease (11/37 lymph nodes), followed by 11 cycles of adjuvant FOLFIRINOX, completed in 01/09/20. She was subsequently diagnosed with biopsy-proven mesenteric nodal recurrence on 09/12/20, and has since received 3 cycles of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel with evidence of favorable treatment response to date. She feels entirely well and is holding her own excellently from a functional and nutritional standpoint    We reviewed her diagnosis, pathology, investigations, and treatment, reinforcing why the mainstay of treatment should consist of systemic therapy with the goal of achieving as deep and durable a remission as possible, hopefully translating into significant prolongation of life, but that treatment 
 was not necessarily expected to be curative. As such, it would be important to carefully weigh the risks/benefits of therapy and to prioritize QoL considerations in the process.    We affirmed her treatment thus far, and would recommend continuing on gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel with an every other week dosing schedule while she is tolerating it adequately, aiming to treat to maximal radiographic/biochemical response or at least 6 cycles in total before considering building in a chemotherapy holiday. She did also inquire about the role for radiation treatment to address any residual disease; I explained that while this can be offered for palliative purposes or to treat isolated recurrences, this modality would not be associated with any clear benefit in terms of prolonging survival.    In terms of future treatment possibilities at a point when her disease progresses, aside from rechallenging with SoC chemotherapy (the combination of 5-FU/LV plus nanoliposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI, or Onivyde) could conceivably be tried, but would likely be of limited yield), we talked about exploring clinical trials which we would be happy to avail her of at *****, although this would very much depend on her overall functional status and goals of care. Possibilities in the future could include:     (1) A study combining nab-paclitaxel and a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist (relacorilant) (includes a pancreas-specific cohort);     (2) A study of pembrolizumab, lenvantinib, and a HIF2a inhibitor (includes a pancreas-specific cohort) -- pending activation;     (3) Other more disease-agnostic trials through our Early Phase Developmental Therapeutics program (e.g. a RAD51 inhibitor, amongst others). There is a trial of an ATR inhibitor for patients with ATM mutations, but there are currently no available slots for patients with pancreas cancer.     Of note, it appears that a FoundationOne panel has been requested for somatic tumor 
 profiling, with results not available at this time although the patient was informed that there were no actionable mutations identified.    All of the patient's questions were answered to her and her family's satisfaction. I am certainly happy to see her again at any point in the future at her request or as clinically indicated.         Time spent:  I spent 60 minutes reviewing the patient's history and medical records in advance, in F2F time during her visit, and in post-visit charting.    Medical decision-making:  Problems: Her active cancer represents a life-threatening illness.  Risk of complications, morbidity/mortality of patient management: High; the patient's systemic cancer therapy requires regular and intensive monitoring for potential major/life-threatening toxicities.

FINDINGS:  Lymph nodes: No hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy.  Lungs: No metastases.  Abdominal and pelvic organs: No metastases.  Bones: No metastases.  Other: Right lateral breast dumbbell shaped enhancing hypermetabolic mass measures 2.7 x 1.7 cm (SUV Max 10.5 for largest component).    Non-oncologic findings:  Brain:   Unremarkable, symmetric, FDG uptake is seen throughout the cortical gray matter, basal ganglia and the cerebellum.  No mass effect.  While these images appear within normal limits, MRI is recommended to rule out intracranial and/or skull base metastases if clinically indicated.  Neck:   Otherwise unremarkable.  Chest:   Unchanged right upper lobe pleural-based mass measuring 2.4 cm x 1.0 cm, dating back to 08/18/2014, without significant FDG avidity. Unchanged left upper and lower lobe pulmonary nodules measuring up to 6 mm in the left lower lobe (series 3, image 121 and image 32).  Abdomen/Pelvis:   Otherwise unremarkable.  Musculoskeletal:   Scattered bone islands in the pelvis are unchanged compared to 08/18/2014. Multilevel degenerative changes of the cervical and lumbar spine. Unchanged 3.4 cm lipomatous lesion in the right tensor fascia lata. Midline abdominal staples.    IMPRESSION: 
   Hypermetabolic  (FDG avid) right lateral breast mass measures 2.7 x 1.7 cm compatible with recurrent disease. No evidence of hypermetabolic metastatic disease.     Right breast diagnostic mammography, Limited R breast US 12/22/2017  Comparison:  Prior examinations dated 10/11/2017, 10/11/2017, 10/04/2017 (MRI) and 01/23/2017 were reviewed for comparison.    Mammographic Findings:  There are scattered areas of fibroglandular density.  BB marker on the upper outer right breast indicating patient-palpated lump corresponds to two masses, both biopsy-proven IDC (ribbon clip and heart clip). The irregular mass containing the ribbon clip now measures approximately 14 mm, previously 11 mm, and the more posterior obscured mass containing the heart clip now measures approximately 15 mm, previously 9 mm.  BB marker on the lower central/slightly outer right breast indicates second patient-palpated lump, for which there is no mammographic correlate.  Ultrasound Findings:  There is no sonographic abnormality (no correlate) to patient-palpated lump in the lower central/slightly outer right breast, at approximately 7 o'clock, 4 cm from nipple.  Limited ultrasound of the right axilla demonstrates lymph nodes with normal cortical thickness and morphology.    IMPRESSION:   Right breast: Known biopsy proven malignancy (BI-RADS 6).    Recommendations:  1. Recommend continued surgical/oncologic management of two-site biopsy-proven right breast malignancy. Of note, right axillary lymph nodes appear sonographically normal at today's examination.    2. Recommend clinical follow up for patient-palpated lump in the lower central/slightly outer right breast, for which there is no mammographic nor sonographic correlate. If indicated, palpation-guided FNA could be pursued.    Bilateral MRI of Breasts 10/04/2017  Comparison:  Prior examinations dated 01/23/2017 (mammogram), 07/08/2016 and 11/10/2015 were reviewed for comparison.  MRI 
 Findings:  This bilateral breast MRI exam demonstrates minimum background enhancement.  There are scattered areas of fibroglandular tissue.    RIGHT Breast:  There is a new 12 x 7 x 7 mm (ML x AP x CC) irregularly shaped mass with spiculated margins in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. Signal intensity/time curve demonstrates rapid initial rise and washout enhancement kinetics.  This lesion is best seen on axial postcontrast image # 90 and sagittal reformation #341.  More posteriorly and laterally in the right breast, there is a second new 6 x 6 x 7 mm (ML x AP x CC) irregularly shaped mass with irregular margins. Signal intensity/time curve demonstrates rapid initial rise and washout enhancement kinetics.  This lesion is best seen on image # 90 and sagittal reformation #363.    LEFT Breast:  The previously described area of non-mass enhancement with linear distribution and clumped internal enhancement in the lower outer left breast is significantly less conspicuous than on MRI dated 07/08/2016, and can no longer be accurately measured. No new abnormal areas of enhancement or other MRI features of malignancy are identified.    IMPRESSION:   Right breast: Suspicious (BI-RADS 4).  Left breast: Benign (BI-RADS 2).    Recommendations:  1. Two new irregular masses demonstrating rapid enhancement with washout are noted in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. Recommend diagnostic right breast mammogram with targeted ultrasound for further evaluation and biopsy planning, with possible stereotactic or ultrasound-guided biopsy to follow. If no correlate is identified by mammogram or ultrasound, then recommend MR-guided core biopsy.    2. Significant interval decrease in conspicuity of the previously described area of non-mass enhancement in the lower outer quadrant of the left breast, compatible with a benign etiology. Annual mammography in addition to MRI is recommended in patients undergoing 
 high-risk screening.        ASSESSMENT & PLAN  ***** ***** ***** is a 71 y.o. female with R breast cancer here for discussion for a new patient visit.       Breast Cancer  - Latest PETCT demonstrates growth of R breast lesion from 1.2 x 0.7 to 2.7 x 1.7 cm  - Patient unsure about starting chemo as we recommended today she would like to speak to Dr. ***** first.     Plan:  Port placement ASAP  Chemo teach ASAP for taxol x 12 weekly  Can start chemo as early as next Wednesday, but the following week also ok. She will need clinic visits with cycles 1, 2, 5, 8, and 12.        I have reviewed and updated the patient's past medical history, medications, allergies, family and social histories. I spent a total of 60 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 45 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the treatment plan, symptoms and therapeutic options. Patient expresses understanding and agrees with the plan.

Lower Thorax: Normal.      Hepatobiliary:    Liver: Measures 14.9 cm in craniocaudal dimension. Multiple varying sized hypodense lesions   throughout the right and left lobes of the liver are present measuring up to 1.7 x 1.4 cm in   segment March 13 (axial image 19, series 2) and 0.9 x 0.8 cm in segments August 15 (axial image 16,   series 2).    Gallbladder: Normal.    Bile Ducts: Normal.    Hepatic vasculature: Normal.     Spleen: A wedge-shaped hypodense area is noted in the lower part of the spleen most likely   related to an infarct. Spleen is upper limits of normal size measuring 12.6 cm.     Pancreas: A 5 x 4.1 cm cystic lesion with irregular rim enhancement is noted involving the   pancreatic tail and abutting the splenic hilum. No pancreatic duct dilatation is noted.     Adrenals: Normal.     Kidneys/Ureters: Normal.     GI Tract:    GE junction and stomach: Normal.    Small bowel: Normal in diameter    Appendix: Not visualized.    Colon and rectum: Diffuse wall thickening of the descending and sigmoid colon is present.     Peritoneum / Retroperitoneum: Nodular foci of enhancement involving the greater omentum is   present. Small peritoneal free fluid is 
 present. Irregular foci of nodular peritoneal   enhancement are present. Example in the left lateral peritoneal line (axial image 42, series   2).     Diffuse mesenteric edema with interspersed fluid is noted.     Lymph Nodes: Multiple retroperitoneal lymph nodes are present in an example left periaortic   lymph node (axial image 42, series 2) measuring 0.9 x 1.1 cm.     Vessels: Moderate atherosclerotic ossification of aorta.     Pelvis:    Prostate: Normal.    Seminal vesicles: Normal.    Bladder: Normal.     Bones and Soft Tissues: Normal.     IMPRESSION:  1. A lobulated cystic lesion with rim enhancement is noted involving the pancreatic tail   measuring 5 x 4.1 cm in size. This may represent a cystic neoplastic process, necrotic   metastatic disease or sequelae of prior inflammation.   2. Multiple hypodense lesions throughout the liver are present suspicious for   metastatic/neoplastic process.   3. Diffuse omental caking and multiple foci of nodular peritoneal enhancement are noted   representing peritoneal carcinomatosis. Small peritoneal free fluid and diffuse mesenteric   edema is present.   4. Wall thickening of the descending and sigmoid colon may be reactive to peritonitis or   related to colitis.   5. Prominent retroperitoneal lymph nodes are present.       Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 51 y.o. male with newly diagnosed metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, still in robust condition overall.    At today's visit, we discussed his diagnosis, pathology, and investigations to date. We reviewed the details of his diagnosis and why the mainstay of treatment should consist of systemic therapy with the goal of achieving as deep and durable a remission as possible, hopefully translating into significant prolongation of life, but that treatment was not expected to be curative. As such, it would be important to carefully weigh the risks/benefits of therapy and to prioritize 
 QoL considerations in the process. In terms of standard of care treatment options, there are several possible chemotherapy regimens to select from for metastatic pancreatic cancer, with the choice of therapy depending on the patient's age, performance status, co-morbid conditions, and personal preference; phase III evidence supports either FOLFIRINOX (biweekly infusional 5-FU, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) or the combination of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel as appropriate front-line choices. We discussed the logistics, scheduling, and some of the potential side effects of these respective regimens including but not limited to nausea/vomiting, alopecia, fatigue, cytopenias with resultant immunosuppression and/or anemia, and peripheral sensory neuropathy/cold sensitivity. If he opts for SoC treatment, I generally start with FOLFIRINOX for fit and otherwise healthy individuals like Mr. *****.    From the standpoint of clinical trial options for the first-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer, we have the following trials here at ***** for which the patient could be considered:    - Our Precision Promise clinical trial platform, supported by the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (PanCAN). In the first-line setting, treatment would entail randomization to either SOC chemotherapy (gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel or FOLFIRINOX); or to one or more experimental therapy arms (presently, the only open experimental arm consists of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel plus pamrevlumab, an anti-CTGF (connective tissue growth factor) monoclonal antibody). Of note,this trial mandates fresh tumor tissue collection both pre- and on-treatment.    - The REVOLUTION (PICI0044) trial, sponsored by the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy (PICI). This trial also employs a platform design intended to test multiple different chemotherapy/immunotherapy combinations; at present, the one cohort open at ***** (cohort B) consists of 
 the combination of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel together with hydroxychloroquine (an anti-autophagy agent) and two doses of low-dose ipilimumab. This trial is non-randomized; and also requires either an adequate amount of archived tumor material or a fresh pre-treatment biopsy for correlative analyses.     Irrespective of trial participation, we also talked about the role of somatic tumor testing of the patient's tumor specimen, if there is adequate cellularity, to assess for the presence of any actionable mutations or other genetic alterations that may inform future treatment options, either using already-approved agents or in the context of clinical trials. This has already been ordered using our UCSF500 in-house platform. I did explain that while this information is always good to have, it will not necessarily yield useful clinical information for treatment purposes.  Additionally, the patient should undergo genetic counseling with germline testing to assess for any hereditary predisposition to cancer, as is now recommended for all individuals with a pancreatic cancer diagnosis, irrespective of family history or known risk factors, as this would have screening implications for family members as well as potentially therapeutic implications for the patient.    From a symptom management perspective:  - No present opioid requirements  - Referral made to our Cancer Center nutritionist    Finally, he is also potentially eligible for several non-therapeutic trials we have here at ***** involving novel imaging and blood- and stool-based assays (for ctDNA and microbiome studies, respectively), if he is interested and chooses to receive his care here at *****.    All of the patient's questions were answered to his and his family's satisfaction. As a starting point, he expressed interest in the REVOLUTION trial, and so we will get him an ICF and move in this direction if he wishes to consent and be screened for this 
 study.      Medical decision-making:  Problems: His active cancer represents a life-threatening illness.  Risk of complications, morbidity/mortality of patient management: High; the patient's systemic cancer therapy requires regular and intensive monitoring for potential major/life-threatening toxicities.  We discussed the following at today's visit:        Time spent:  I spent 75 minutes reviewing the patient's history and medical records in advance, in F2F time during his visit, and in post-visit charting..

train_15	1	"Mr. ***** is a 74 y.o. male who returns to our GI Oncology practice at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center for follow-up of his metastatic pancreatic cancer, originally diagnosed 2018.    Treatment summary to date:  -He initially received 4 cycles of FOLFIRINOX, through early November 2017; this was quite poorly tolerated overall, with progressive anorexia and fatigue. He then held off on further treatment for the next couple of months.  -After our initial meeting on 01/14/2018, he was agreeable to try additional chemotherapy with FOLFOX, and has now completed 13 cycles through 08/19/2018. The 5-FU bolus was d/c'ed beginning cycle #4 due to mild thrombocytopenia (plts = 88K);beginning cycle #9, his dosing interval was spaced out from q2 to q3 weeks; and beginning cycle #11, the oxaliplatin was dropped altogether. He completed 13 cycles of treatment altogether, through 08/17/2018.  - On chemotherapy holiday over the next 2  months so he could enjoy his daughter's upcoming ***** in mid-September; repeat imaging thereafter (10/14/2018) showed evidence of both locoregional and metastatic disease progression  - Started on 2L treatment with the combination of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel on a QOW dosing schedule (days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle) beginning 10/26/2018. After 2 treatment cycles, was noted to have further disease progression in pancreas, liver, and spleen, with waxing and waning size of multiple peritoneal implants  - Switched to 3L treatment with the combination of 5-FU/LV plus nanoliposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI, or Onivyde), beginning 12/28/2018; received 4 treatment cycles through the end of January. Well-tolerated overall, with only mild fatigue (not preventing him from playing tennis) and minimal GI side fx. Repeat imaging (02/15/2019) demonstrated overall stable disease, with slightly improving hepatic metastases and simultaneously stable to minimally enlarging peritoneal metastases  - Interrupted rx to 
 take a17-day trip to *****; did well for most of the trip, but toward the end and since returning home on 03/06/2019, began noting increasing abdominal/mid-back pain. Was noted to be anemic (Hgb 7.0) without evident GI bleed, so underwent PRBC tx x 2 units and underwent EGD (03/16/2019) notable for partial gastric outlet obstruction, through which a 25 mm by 8 cm enteric stent was placed.  - Resumed chemotherapy (cycle #5 of nal-IRI/5-FU/LV) on 03/29/2019.    Interval history/review of systems  - Tolerating POs adequately since stent placement, w/o postprandial vomiting; however, appetite generally poor  - Occasional bilateral abdominal pain; uses Norco twice-daily  - Generalized fatigue, with waxing/waning energy level  - No melena or suggestion of GI bleeding  - No fevers/chills      Medications the patient states to be taking prior to today's encounter.

Visualized lung bases:  For chest findings, please see the separately dictated report from the CT of the chest of the same date. Liver:  Increased, now moderate to severe intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation in the left hepatic lobe. Interval slightly decreased size of hypodense 0.7 x 0.7 cm lesion in segment 6 (series 7 image 49), previously 1.1 x 0.8 cm. Interval slightly decreased size of ill-defined nodule along the inferior hepatic margin, now measuring 1.3 x 0.9 cm compared to 1.5 x 1.2 cm previously with new central hypodensity (series 7 image 56). Gallbladder: Unremarkable Spleen:  No significant change in hypodense splenic lesions. Adrenal Glands:  Unremarkable Kidneys:  Hypodense renal mass(es) too small to characterize, either benign or clinically insignificant, unchanged. GI Tract:  Small paraesophageal hernia. Vasculature:  Unremarkable Lymphadenopathy: Absent Peritoneum: Unchanged 1.4 x 1.2 cm nodule in the right paracolic gutter (series 7 image 72). Slightly increased size of left paracolic gutter nodule measuring 1.3 x 1.0 cm, previously 1.1 x 0.9 cm (series 7 image 64). 
 Similar anterior left upper quadrant nodule measuring 1.1 x 0.9 cm, previously 1.1 x 1.0 cm (series 7 image 43). Previously described peritoneal implant in the lesser curvature the stomach is less conspicuous, but likely unchanged in size. Bladder: Unremarkable Reproductive organs: Unremarkable Bones:  No suspicious lesions Extraperitoneal soft tissues: Unremarkable Lines/drains/medical devices: None     1.

Increase in now moderate intrahepatic biliary dilation in the left hepatic lobe without a clear obstructing lesion. 3.  Unchanged chronic occlusion of the splenic vein and tumor encasement of the splenic artery.     Result Date: 02/15/2019  CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST   FINDINGS: LUNGS: Unchanged left lower lobe nodule measuring 3 mm (series 2 ***** 123); on the most remote prior in 2018 this nodule measured 6 mm. New patchy peribronchial vascular groundglass opacities in the left lower lobe (series 2 ***** 167). Unchanged right middle lobe scarring and calcified granulomata. PLEURA: No pleural effusion. MEDIASTINUM: No lymphadenopathy. HEART/GREAT VESSELS: Unchanged mild cardiomegaly and postsurgical changes status post CABG BONES/SOFT TISSUES: No suspicious osseous lesions.     1. Unchanged left lower lobe nodule, decrease in size compared to most remote prior, possibly inflammatory versus treated metastasis. 2. New patchy groundglass left lower lobe mild opacities, likely infectious.       Result Date: 03/11/2019 (outside)  CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  FINDINGS:  Inferior Chest: The heart is enlarged in size. No pericardial  effusion. There is a small left pleural effusion. Patchy ground-glass  and airspace opacities in the inferior right middle lobe and left lung  base, may 
 represent atelectasis versus infection. The lung bases are  clear.    Liver: Liver is normal in size and smooth in contour. Circumscribed  subcentimeter hyperdensities in the caudate lobe and inferior right  hepatic lobe, too small to accurately characterize. There is an ill  defined contour deforming hypodense lesion in the inferior right  hepatic lobe measuring approximately 1.4 cm in diameter (axial image  55). Portal and hepatic veins are patent.    Gallbladder and biliary tree: The gallbladder appears unremarkable.  There is prominent intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation predominantly  involving the left hepatic lobe. The common bile duct appears normal in  caliber.    Pancreas/spleen: There is an ill defined mixed solid and cystic mass  involving the tail of the pancreas associated with few coarse  calcifications, measuring approximately 7.2 cm AP by 5.4 cm transverse  by 5.6 cm craniocaudal. This mass abuts the splenic hilum with  multiple cystic spaces within the spleen and loss of fat plane,  suggestive of direct invasion. Large wedge-shaped areas of  hypoenhancement within the peripheral aspects of spleen suggestive of  multiple splenic infarcts. There is loss of fat plane between the  pancreatic mass in the posterior wall of the stomach suggestive of  possible direct invasion.    Adrenals: The right adrenal gland appears unremarkable. There is mild  diffuse thickening of the left adrenal gland without definite focal  nodularity. Subtle loss of fat plane between the left adrenal gland  and pancreatic tail mass (axial image 55).    Kidneys: Bilateral subcentimeter hypodensities, too small to  accurately characterize but statistically likely to represent benign  cysts.The left kidney appears slightly inferior displaced. There is a  loss of fat plane between the anterior aspect of the left kidney and a  pancreatic tail mass (axial image 64). No nephrolithiasis or  hydronephrosis.    GI tract: There 
 is mucosal hyperenhancement involving the distal aspect  of the stomach adjacent to likely direct invasion from pancreatic mass.  There is associated wall thickening/ edema. Proximal stomach is  distended with fluid and food material. Findings concerning for at  least partial gastric outlet obstruction. There is mild wall edema of  the visualized distal esophagus. Small bowel loops are grossly normal  in course in caliber with no significant wall thickening or dilatation.  There is wall thickening involving the transverse colon, and descending  colon, and sigmoid colon. In the region of the splenic flexure, there  is loss of fat plane between the ill defined pancreatic tail mass and  the colon.    Bladder: Urinary bladder appears unremarkable.    Reproductive organs: The prostate gland is mildly prominent in size  measuring 4.6 x 4.2 x 4.5 cm.    Peritoneal Cavity: There is a small amount of free fluid noted in the  abdomen in the perihepatic space, perisplenic space, bilateral  paracolic gutters, and pelvis. No free air is identified. No  retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.    Vasculature: Scattered atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal  aorta and its main branches with no hemodynamically significant  stenosis or occlusion.    Bones and Soft tissues: No acute osseous abnormality. Multilevel  degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine and bilateral  sacroiliac joints. Very small fat containing left inguinal hernia.  There is mild anasarca of the subcutaneous tissues. Few foci of air in  the right anterior abdominal wall, likely representing recent injection.    IMPRESSION:  1. Ill defined mixed solid and cystic pancreatic tail mass with few  coarse calcifications, measuring at least 7.2 x 5.4 x 5.6 cm. There is  direct invasion of the spleen and posterior stomach. There is also  questionable direct invasion of the splenic flexure of colon common the  left adrenal gland, and the 
 left kidney.  2. Proximal gastric distension. Diffuse gastric wall edema with  mucosal hyperenhancement of the distal stomach, compatible with direct  invasion from adjacent pancreatic tail mass causing at least partial  gastric outlet obstruction.  3. Multiple peripheral wedge-shaped areas of hypoenhancement throughout  the spleen compatible with multiple splenic infarcts.  4. Diffuse wall edema of the transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon.  Possible direct invasion from pancreatic tail mass at the level of the  splenic flexure. Other possibilities include colitis of infectious or  inflammatory etiologies.  5. Small left pleural effusion. Patchy ground-glass and airspace  opacities in the inferior right middle lobe and left lung base,  possibly representing atelectasis versus infiltrate/infection.  6. Ill defined contour deforming hypodense lesion within the inferior  right hepatic lobe measuring 1.4 cm, concerning for metastatic disease  in this clinical setting.  7. Small volume diffuse abdominal ascites.      Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Mr. ***** is a 74 y.o. male with metastatic PDAC, currently on 3L treatment consisting of the combination of 5-FU/LV plus nanoliposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI, or Onivyde), but with some evidence concerning of continued clinical/symptomatic decline.    At this point it is important to carefully weigh the risks/benefits of continuing on with therapy and the need to prioritize QoL considerations in the process. We may need to consider the option of refocusing his goals on purely palliative/symptomatic measures with a transition to home hospice at some point in the near future. For now, we agreed on the following:    - Continue with 1 additional cycle of the same chemotherapy (scheduled for tomorrow, if laboratory parameters are acceptable), with short-term f/u CT scans to assess for evidence of further disease progression  - From a standpoint of further 
 salvage therapy, his options would primarily consist of clinical trials, which would mainly consist of non-disease-specific phase I clinical trials through our Early Phase Developmental Therapeutics practice. One possibility to consider would be trying him on the combination of trametinib plus hydroxychloroquine; there is some promising preliminary data with this MEKi/antimalarial combination in terms of inhibiting autophagy in pancreatic cancer. We are hoping to open this trial at ***** in conjunction with Univ of ***** by early 2020, but the patient could potentially receive this combination off-label sooner than that. Of note, his tumor harbors KRAS (G12D) and p53 mutations.  - We could also consider RT to his pancreatic primary, which would be primarily for palliative/QoL purposes rather than necessarily extending his longevity.    I spent a total of 25 minutes face-to-face with the patient and family, of which greater than 50% was spent in counseling regarding his cancer diagnosis. He understands and is in agreement with the plan.

Following intravenous administration of 8.1 mCi of F18-FDG, a contrast enhanced, diagnostic CT was performed. This was followed by an emission PET scan started 52 minutes after FDG injection.  PET images were corrected for attenuation using the CT transmission data.  PET/CT was acquired from vertex to thighs. A rotating 3D MIP, as well as axial, coronal, and sagittal PET images with and without attenuation correction was interpreted.  Acquired and fused PET/CT images were reviewed alongside the PET images.  Patient's random blood glucose at the time of FDG injection was 94 mg/dL.  RADIATION DOSE INDICATORS: ***** ***** received 2 exposure event(s) (excluding scout) 
 during this CT study. The range of CTDIvol was 9.04 to 9.04 (mGy) and the TOTAL DLP was 923.24 (mGy-cm). The dose indicators for CT are the volume Computed Tomography Dose Index (CTDIvol) and the Dose Length Product (DLP), and are measured in units of mGy and mGy-cm, respectively. These indicators are not patient dose, but values generated from the CT scanner acquisition factors.  Individual patient doses calculated from these values will depend on patient size and can substantially underestimate or overestimate the actual dose.

Core biopsy for clinical and research purposes. TECHNIQUE: Procedure was explained in detail to patient.  Risks (including risks of pain, infection, bleeding, non-recovery of targeted lesion, possible need for further intervention for diagnostic purposes), benefits, and alternatives discussed.  All questions were answered.  Written and verbal informed consent obtained.  This procedure immediately followed fine-needle aspiration.  Under sterile conditions, the lesion was re-identified at the 12 o'clock position, 3 cm from the nipple in the right breast. Following administration of a 1% Lidocaine with epinephrine, a small dermatotomy was made in the skin with a scalpel and a 14-16 gauge needle was placed under direct sonographic guidance with its tip at the lesion. Pre and post fire images demonstrated transgression of the needle through the lesion. A total of 8 biopsy samples were obtained (4 clinical, 4 research). Sterile Steri-Strips were placed at the incision site. The patient tolerated the procedure well and left the department in satisfactory condition with instructions that if excessive bleeding or oozing should occur, she should contact her health care provider or visit an emergency room. She may obtain the results from her referring physician within 4 working days and if this is not possible, she may contact this department.

END OF IMPRESSION:     Mr Breast With And Without Contrast, Bilateral    Result Date: 04/15/2017  Exam Date: 04/15/2017 Exam(s): MR breast bilateral en + un Clinical History: 32-year-old woman with biopsy proven right breast cancer (outside hospital). Patient underwent repeat core biopsy here at ***** (with research cores) and fine needle aspiration of a suspicious right axillary node (results pending at the time of this MRI). Comparison: Prior examinations dated 04/11/2017 (ultrasound) and 03/19/2017 were reviewed for comparison. MRI Technique: Bilateral 1.5T breast MRI without and with contrast was performed with a dedicated breast coil using T1 and T2-weighted sequences including:  axial T2-weighted with fat saturation, high resolution T1 fat-suppressed 3D gradient echo pre-, and dynamic post-contrast sequences. Gadolinium based contrast was injected intravenously at a dose of 0.1 millimole per kilogram body weight without adverse reaction. The study was processed with a Hologic Aegis Sentinelle system to optimize interpretation by generating multiplanar reconstructions (MPRs) and maximum intensity projections (MIPs) in 3 dimensions using raw and generated subtracted images from the dynamic contrast enhanced data set. MRI Findings: This bilateral breast MRI exam demonstrates moderate background enhancement. The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue and fat. RIGHT Breast: There is a 34 x 20 x 25 mm irregularly shaped mass with spiculated margins and heterogeneous enhancement in the upper central to slightly outer right breast (axial image 59, sag image 413). Signal intensity/time curve demonstrates rapid initial rise and washout enhancement kinetics. Susceptibility 
 artifact within the mass corresponds to the clip within the mass. No other abnormal areas of enhancement or other MRI features of malignancy are identified in the right breast. LEFT Breast: No abnormal areas of enhancement or other MRI features of malignancy are identified. There is an enlarged right axillary lymph node with a cortex measuring up to 6 mm, likely corresponding to the recently sample axillary lymph node. IMPRESSION: Right breast: Known biopsy proven malignancy (BI-RADS 6). Left breast: Negative (BI-RADS 1). Recommendations: Recommend continued surgical and oncologic follow up of the known right breast cancer. Additionally, recommend correlation with cytology results of the recently sampled suspicious right axillary node. Recommend continued annual screening mammography for the left breast, according to American Cancer Society guidelines.

Mammoprint expected on Thursday of this week.  I had previously discussed ISPY2 with her in detail when she met our surgery team on 04/11/17 and signed consent at that time.  I reviewed the protocol and treatment again today including randomization, secondary consent, biopsies, MRI scans that are at least somewhat dependent on response, and novel agents currently in the study as well as the control arm.  We discussed the need for hormone therapy after surgery, the use of ovarian suppression and the side effects of OS.  We also talked about subsequent pregnancies, and when we recommend this depending on her response and stage at time of surgery.    We talked about standard of care therapy, including weekly paclitaxel x 12 followed by AC every 2-3 weeks with neulasta support, and including the short and long term toxicities with these therapies.  I have recommended a port for her treatment which she agrees to.  We reviewed her pathology and all of her imaging as well as her clear PET scan.    All of her questions were answered in full.  Plan:  04/23/17 echocardiogram and EKG  Hoping to do Mammi/PET on 05/01/17 - since we hope to start 
 chemotherapy then, we have worked with the imaging group and they were able to move her scan to April 29..  Port to be placed either on start of therapy or one week later.  Cold cap coordinator to call her.  Discussed the cold caps, and cost, as well as the success rate being relatively lower with AC.    Auth for chemotherapy placed as well as port.    Labs on Thursday.    Hopefully start neoadjuvant chemotherapy next week - planning for 05/01/17 assuming egg harvesting either Saturday or Monday.    Discussed toxicity in detail including hair loss, ovarian suppression, neuropathy, cardiac toxicity, small risk of secondary malignancies, and acute toxicities such as nausea, diarrhea, constipation, nail changes, etc.    Patient ready and able to be educated, verbalizes understanding of information/instructions given.

train_17	0	"ID: ***** ***** is a 33 y.o. premenopausal patient with a recent diagnosis of a HR+ metastatic breast cancer involving lymph nodes, who presents in consultation to discuss treatment options and to establish care.    HPI: The patient was evaluated by her PCP on 10/30/16 at which time she reported a new right lateral neck lump.  Her exam was notable for a hard, mobile mass (1 cm) on her right lateral neck.  She was recommended to return in 2 weeks if not resolved.  She returned on 11/09/16 with concern that the lymph nodes were increasing in size (0.5 cm mobile mass in right anterior chain; 2 x 1 cm mass and subcentimeter masses of right lateral neck).  She was recommended to get a CBC and return in 2 weeks at which time, if persistent, they would obtain imaging.  She returned on 12/27/16 at which time she reported the LN were smaller and sore with palpation.  Her exam at that time was noted to be supple with a 0.5 cm soft, mobile LN in the right mid-cervical chain.  She was reassured the nodes were shotty and to continue to monitor them.  Finally, she returned on 03/26/17 with concern the nodes were grainy and stable in size, but had started to cause pain.  Her exam at that time demonstrated fullness (1.5 to 2 cm) along the right anterior and superior cervical chain as well as a firm round mass (2 x 2 cm) in the right lateral neck.  The following work-up was then initiated.    03/30/17 Neck US: diffuse bilateral submandibular, anterior, and posterior cervical adenopathy (R submandibular 3.6 x 1.7 cm; R anterior cervical chain 1.0 x 0.8 cm; L anterior cervical 2.7 x 1.0 cm; L posterior lateral neck inferiorly 0.9 x 0.7 cm); thyroid unremarkable    04/03/17 US-guided right supraclavicular LN biopsy: metastatic adenocarcinoma, c/w breast primary (CK7, GATA3, ER - positive; CK20, TTF1, thyroglobulin, napsin, mammaglobin - negative); ER+ (>90%), PR+ (50%), HER2 equivocal (IHC 2; FISH pending)    04/10/17 bilateral diagnostic

COMMENTS:   The aspirates are moderately cellular and demonstrate clusters of  crowded, malignant epithelial cells arranged in cohesive aggregates and  papillary-like groups. The cells contain enlarged and angulated  hyperchromatic nuclei with coarse chromatin, nuclear grooves, and one to  multiple nucleoli. The cytoplasm is dense and eosinophilic, imparting  and apocrine appearnce. A rare intranuclear pseudoinclusion and  scattered mitotic figures are identified.    To further evaluate the neoplastic cells immunohistochemical stains were  performed and evaluated on the cell block and show the following  results:  - CK7: Positive  - CK20: Negative  - Thyroglobulin: Negative  - TTF1: Negative  - Napsin: Negative  - p40: Negative  - p63: Negative  - Mammaglobin: Negative  - GATA3: Positive  - GCDFP15: Negative  - PAX8: Negative  - ER: Positive     The cytopathologic and immunohistochemical findings are most compatible  with metastatic carcinoma of breast primary. Correlation with clinical  and radiologic findings is recommended.    ***** *****, NP, at ***** ***** was contacted with the diagnosis on  04/06/2017. She relayed an understanding of the diagnosis.    Immunohistochemical tests for estrogen and progesterone receptors, HER2  and Ki-67 were performed by manual morphometry on the cell block.    The test for estrogen receptors is positive. There is 3+ nuclear  staining in >90% of tumor cells. Internal positive 
 control is present,  and external positive control is appropriate.    The test for progesterone receptors is positive. There is variable  (weak to strong, November 28+) nuclear staining in 50% of tumor cells. Internal  positive control is present, and external positive control is  appropriate.    Result of HER2 test: This carcinoma is equivocal for HER2 oncoprotein  over-expression. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 2 on a  scale of 0-3.     ***** *****/Pathology Resident   ***** ***** *****/Pathologist  Electronically signed out on *****/*****/***** *****:*****:19    Addendum   Date Ordered:   04/06/2017   Status:  Signed Out    Date Complete:   04/10/2017   By: ***** *****    Date Reported:   04/10/2017     Addendum Diagnosis    - CA125: Weak patchy staining  - CAIX: Negative   - RCC: Negative  - Calcitonin: Negative    The additional immunohistochemical stains support the morphologic  findings. The previously reported diagnosis remains unchanged.     Exam Date: 04/10/2017  Exam(s): Bilateral diagnostic mammography, right breast ultrasound    Clinical History:  33-year-old woman having diagnostic mammography to evaluate for primary breast malignancy. Patient had recent cervical lymph node FNA positive for breast adenocarcinoma. Receptors are pending per APEX.    Comparison:  There are no prior examinations available for comparison.    Mammographic Findings:  The breasts are extremely dense, which lowers the sensitivity of mammography.  There is right axillary lymphadenopathy including an enlarged calcified lymph node.  No mammographic features of primary malignancy in the right or left breast.    Ultrasound Findings:  There are multiple axillary lymph nodes with the cortex measuring up to 8mm. Additionally there is an enlarged right axillary lymph node with calcifications, which corresponds to the right axillary calcified enlarged lymph node on mammogram.    IMPRESSION:  Right breast: 
 Known biopsy proven malignancy (BI-RADS 6).  Left breast: Negative (BI-RADS 1).    Recommendations:  Breast MRI to evaluate for underlying breast primary malignancy which is scheduled for 04/12/17. Patient is also scheduled for PET/CT tomorrow to evaluate for additional sites of disease.    Findings and management plan discussed with patient during the exam by Dr. *****.

Comparison:  Prior examinations dated 04/10/2017 (ultrasound) and 04/10/2017 (mammogram) were reviewed for comparison.    MRI Findings:  This bilateral breast MRI exam demonstrates marked background enhancement.  The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue and fat.    RIGHT Breast:  Marked background enhancement is seen, with the most confluent area of enhancement occurring in the right upper outer breast, posterior depth (best seen on post-gadolinium axial image #101, sagittal image #363), measuring up to 3.5 cm in AP dimension. This is only slightly more prominent on the right compared with the left side, and appears to correspond with the area noted on recent PET CT.  A more superficial and smaller right axillary tail mass is seen measuring approximately 1.5 x 0.5 x 1.0 cm (best seen on post-gadolinium axial image #104, sagittal image #369), which 
 demonstrates suggestion of susceptibility artifact on T1 imaging and may correspond to the area of calcifications seen on mammogram. This appears to enhance with slightly greater intensity than the breast tissue described above.    LEFT Breast:  Marked background enhancement is seen. No abnormal areas of enhancement or other MRI features of malignancy are identified.    OTHER:  Markedly enlarged right axillary lymph nodes are seen with cortical thickness measuring up to 1 cm. Left axillary lymph nodes are unremarkable. Visualized abdomen and remainder of the chest is unremarkable.    IMPRESSION:  Right breast: Suspicious (BI-RADS 4).  Left breast: Negative (BI-RADS 1).    Recommendations:  1. Recommend second look ultrasound to evaluate 2 areas: (1) the area of more confluent enhancement in the upper outer right breast and (2) the right axillary tail mass which may correspond to the calcification-containing lesion on mammogram, with plan for ultrasound-guided core biopsy of these areas if correlates can be found, else recommend MRI-guided biopsy.    2. Abnormally enlarged right axillary lymph nodes are again seen, compatible with known metastatic disease.

No definite primary seen, however heterogeneous breast tissue with nodular area of increased FDG avidity noted in the outer right breast. Correlate with mammographic findings.    This study was reviewed by attendings Dr. ***** ***** from ***** ***** and Dr. ***** ***** ***** of Nuclear Medicine.    END OF IMPRESSION    Assessment and Recommendations:  33 y.o. premenopausal patient with a recent diagnosis of HR+ breast cancer metastasized to a supraclavicular lymph node, and presumptively to cervical nodes, who requires additional work-up prior to receiving complete treatment recommendations.    I discussed with ***** in great detail the natural history and treatment of hormone receptor positive breast cancer.  We reviewed the available pathology and imaging reports.  As her workup is not yet complete, I could not provide a complete explanation.  Presumptively, she has a primary breast cancer that 
 has metastasized to axillary, supraclavicular, and cervical lymph nodes.  In order to prove this hypothesis, she will need a core biopsy of suspicious breast tissue (if possible) as well as an FNA of a cervical lymph node.  She has no other evidence of distant metastasis.  I stated that it is unlikely, but she could have a second primary involving her cervical nodes.    I explained to ***** that if we confirm the above with breast and cervical LN biopsies, then she would be given a diagnosis of a de novo MBC.  I explained that technically, we do not consider MBC to be curable.  I stated that this disease is treatable, however, and that many patients live for many years.  She asked many questions about prognosis (repeatedly), and I did my best to help her understand that it is difficult to predict prognosis in the setting of a disease like hers and that we will learn about her disease's biology (and long term prognosis) after she starts a therapy.    Her HER2 status is not yet complete; she was noted to have HER2 equivocal by IHC and the FISH is not yet resulted.  I stated that if she does have HER2 positive disease, she would have even more treatment options, which would include chemotherapy initially.  I explained that if she has HER2 negative disease, then we would initiate treatment with antiestrogen therapy (not chemotherapy).    The patient will return to clinic once additional testing has been completed.    Recommendations in Brief:  - US-guided biopsy of breast mass (possibly calcified nodule in axillary tail)  - cervical LN FNA if possible  - f/u on HER2 FISH result  - genetic testing    I spent a total of 100 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 95 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the diagnosis, the treatment plan, the prognosis, medication risks, lifestyle modification, the risks and benefits of surgery, symptoms and therapeutic options.

Ms. *****'s history is notable for a screening mammogram performed 01/25/17, which was read as unremarkable with BI-RADS 1.  Several months later, she noticed a left breast mass.  She underwent another mammogram on 05/27/17 that showed several solid masses (solid mass in the left breast at 3 o'clock; a solid mass in the left breast at 1 o'clock; prominent lymph node in the left axilla).  Ultrasound performed at ***** showed a 11 x 12 x 12 mm irregular, heterogeneous hypoechoic solid mass in the outer central left breast at ~3 o'clock and a 15 x 12 x 14 mm irregular solid mass in the upper outer left breast at ~2 o'clock likely within the large area of multiple small masses seen at mammography, and at least two abnormal L axillary lymph nodules.  A 06/20/17 ultrasound-guided core biopsy of the L breast mass at  3 o'clock showed invasive ductal carcinoma, as well as ductal carcinoma in situ, intermediate nuclear grade, and microcalcification associated with ductal carcinoma in situ, with strong ER positive (100%), strong PR positive (>95%), and HER-2 negative (1+ IHC).She also underwent a FNA of a left axillary lymph node that revealed metastatic carcinoma of the breast.      She was evaluated by Dr. ***** of breast surgical oncology and the patient opted to pursue bilateral double mastectomies.  She was admitted from *****/*****/*****-*****/*****/***** for bilateral mastectomies, left axillary lymph node dissection, levels 1 and 2, and bilateral plastics closure.  Her pathology showed IDC multifocal, SBR grade 2 and 1, 
 largest focus 3.9 cm, margins negative; Ductal carcinoma in situ, intermediate nuclear grade, metastatic carcinoma to two lymph nodes (2/2), 1.5 cm largest deposit, microcalcifications in association with ductal carcinoma in situ and benign ducts.  She was last seen by Dr. ***** in clinic on 08/31/17 where her surgical sites were well-healed and her JP drains were removed. She presents today to establish medical oncology care.

COMMENT:  For the left mastectomy specimen (part B), two lesions are 
 identified  grossly. The first lesion (designated as lesion #1 in the gross  description) is in the lower central breast, measures 3.0 cm and is  associated with a biopsy clip. This lesion shows a single continuous  invasive ductal carcinoma microscopically, spans slices 9 to 11 and  measures 3.0 cm (tumor #1 in the synoptic comment). The second lesion  (lesion #2) is superior to lesion #1 and appears multinodular grossly in  slices 7 to 11. Extensive and sequential sampling of lesion #1 shows  extensive DCIS with three separate foci of invasive carcinoma:  designated as tumors #2 to 4 as in the synoptic comment. Tumor #2 is in  slice 7 and tumor #3 in slices 9 to 11, separated by slice 8, which  shows DCIS without invasion (slides B7 and B26). Tumor #1 and tumor #3  are separated by 1.8 cm of DCIS as in slide B9. Tumor #4 is in ***** 9  and is 0.8 cm away from tumor #3 as in slide B10.

Lymph node, left axillary, ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration:  Positive for metastatic carcinoma; see comment.     COMMENTS:   The aspirates are abundantly cellular and reveal scattered irregular  sheets of malignant cells, some forming glandular structures. The cells  have enlarged nuclei with irregular nuclear contours and scant to  moderate cytoplasm. The cell block sample is concordant. The findings  are consistent with metastatic carcinoma of the breast. See also the  corresponding left breast core biopsy (*****-*****).       Assessment / Plan:   ***** ***** is a 70 y.o. female with a h/o HTN, HLD, and a 
 recent diagnosis of stage IIA pT2(m)N1a L breast IDC (3.9 cm, grade 2, ER+/PR+/HER- with FISH ratio 1.1, high-risk mammaprint) s/p 08/18/17 bilateral mastectomies with left axillary LND with 2/12 LN+, who presents to establish Oncology care.    She has stage IIA IDC with known lymph node involvement (2 out of 12 nodes), and she has completed bilateral mastectomies.  Given her early stage breast cancer with positive LN involvement, the mammaprint is essential in determining the next steps in her care.  Her Mammaprint resulting as high-risk, supporting that she would benefit from chemotherapy in addition to the use of an aromatase inhibitor.  Today we discussed in detail the options for the next steps in chemotherapy, and our recommendation to pursue treatment with AC with paclitaxel.  We discussed the potential side effects of chemotherapy, including fatigue, n/v, and hair loss, among others.  She is in agreement to pursue treatment, which we recommend starting about 2 months post-operatively (so estimated 10/18/2017).  Prior to chemotherapy she will need a baseline TTE given the potential cardiotoxic side effects of an anthracycline, IV access (she prefers a PAC), and chemotherapy teaching.    Of note is her strong family history of breast cancer along her paternal side, which is also of ***** Jewish heritage making her a potentially BRCA positive.  She is in agreement to pursue genetic counseling, and we referred her for genetic testing.    Plan:  - patient agreed to start chemotherapy with AC + paclitaxel, estimated start date 10/18/2017  - ordered for pre-chemotherapy TTE  - requested pre-chemotherapy teaching  - port placement ordered  - referral placed to Genetics    All of the patients questions and concerns were answered to her satisfaction.  This patient was evaluated and discussed with attending, Dr. *****.    ***** *****, MD  Hematology/Oncology Fellow  09/19/17

A time out was held. The patient's left breast was prepped in the usual sterile fashion. Local anesthesia was achieved with 1% lidocaine, along with 1% lidocaine with diluted epinephrine Gadolinium based contrast (5 cc of Gadavist) was administered intravenously without difficulty and the finding in question at the posterior left 6:00 position was visualized. Using MRI guidance and grid compression, a 9 gauge vacuum assisted core biopsy device was used to obtain tissue samples. A titanium marker was placed after the biopsy. The patient tolerated procedure well with no immediate Complications. Pathology showed proliferative fibrocystic changes without atypia.   IMPRESSIONS:  MRI-guided core biopsy of a 4 mm focus of 
 contrastenhancement in the posterior, lower (6:00) region of the left breast.Pathology showed fibrocystic changes.This is concordant with the imaging findings.Recommendation would be for breast MRI in 6 months as per the usual imaging surveillance protocol for benign concordant diagnosis.  05/09/2017 Left Breast Ultrasound Limited  LEFT ULTRASOUND FINDINGS: A targeted ultrasound was performed of the left breast at 6 o'clock located 3 centimeters from the nipple. There is no sonographic correlate to the MRI finding in the left lower central breast  IMPRESSION  There is no sonographic finding to the MRI finding of a 4 mm focus of enhancement in the left lower central breast. Therefore, recommend MRI-guided biopsy of the focus of enhancement in the left lower central breast, as per MRI report. The results of this examination were reviewed directly with the patient by a member of the Breast Health Center, and a written summary report was provided to her. BI-RADS Category 1 : Negative    05/06/2017 MRI BREAST BILATERAL WWO CONTRAST  FINDINGS: The breasts demonstrate heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue. There is minimal background enhancement that is symmetric.  Right breast: There are no abnormal areas of contrast enhancement.  Left breast: Postoperative changes in the left breast with a seroma in the left breast at 12:00 extending from the nipple areolar complex to the pectoralis muscle. The seroma measures 8.6 x 4.6 cm (AP, transverse). The craniocaudal extent of the anterior portion of the seroma measures 5.1 cm in the posterior portion measures 2.9 cm. The posterior portion of the seroma measures 3.4 x 1.1 x 2.9 cm (AP, transverse, CC). There is peripheral enhancement surrounding the seroma. There is irregular peripheral enhancement along the anterolateral superior margin of the anterior portion of the seroma (postcontrast axial image 54 and 49 and sagittal image 32) and along the posterolateral aspect of the 
 anterior portion of the seroma (postcontrast axial image 42 and sagittal 39). The nodular peripheral enhancement extends to the nipple areolar complex. There is also nodular peripheral enhancement along the medial margin of the anterior portion of the seroma(postcontrast axial image 45 and sagittal image 53). The peripheral enhancement demonstrates type I kinetics. No fat plane between the peripheral enhancement of the seroma and the left pectoralis muscle. 4 x 2 x 4 mm focus of enhancement in the posterior left breast at 6:00 (postcontrast axial image 72 and sagittal image 44). Kinetics curve assessment demonstrates type I enhancement There is diffuse skin thickening, likely related to postoperative changes.  Other: Postoperative seroma in the left axilla from recent sentinel lymph node dissection measuring 6.6 x 4.0 x at least 5.5 cm (AP, transverse, CC). The full craniocaudad extent of this seroma is not imaged. There is thin peripheral enhancement surrounding the seroma, which is due to postoperative changes. There is no axillary or internal mammary lymphadenopathy.  IMPRESSION:  Right breast: BI-RADS 1: Negative. Recommend annual mammogramthe right breast.  Left breast: BI-RADS 4C: High suspicion for malignancy. Irregular peripheral enhancement along the anterior, anterolateral, medial, and posterolateral aspect of the anterior portion of the seroma in the left breast at 12:00 is suspicious for residual disease. Differential diagnosis includes postoperative inflammation given recent lumpectomy. Recommend surgical consultation. 4 mm focus of enhancement in the left breast at 6:00 is mildly suspicious (4A). Recommend targeted ultrasound. If there is no sonographic correlate, recommend MRI guided biopsy.  04/30/2017 NM Sentinel node imaging of the left breast  FINDINGS:  Expected intense activity is noted at the injection site at the  left breast. 3 foci of tracer uptake in the left axilla,  compatible with 
 sentinel lymph nodes.    04/21/2017 Left Breast US Guided Biopsy, Left Post-Biopsy Mammogram  Pathology Results: Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma (see final pathology report). This was concordant with the imaging impression. Recommend surgical excision. Results, recommendations and plans for management were discussed with the patient by the Breast Health Center clinical nurse specialist. Patient to follow up with Dr ***** *****.    04/10/2017 Bilateral Digital Diagnostic Mammogram w/CAD, Left Breast Ultrasound Limited   BILATERAL MAMMOGRAM FINDINGS  The breasts are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses. There is an irregular mass measuring 20 millimeters with spiculated margin in the left breast at 12 o'clock.This is best seen on the tomosynthesis views. The right breast appears unremarkable.  LEFT ULTRASOUND FINDINGS  A targeted ultrasound was performed of the left breast at 12 o'clock  located 2 centimeters from the nipple. Ultrasound is suggestive of a solid mass measuring 17 millimeters in the left breast at 12 o'clock located 2 centimeters from the nipple.This corresponds to the palpable finding of clinical concern.  IMPRESSION  Solid mass in the left breast is highly suggestive of malignancy.  Ultrasound-guided core biopsy is recommended. The referring physician was notified of these results by fax. The left axilla will be evaluated with ultrasound when the patient returns for biopsy. If there adenopathy, US guided core biopsy will be performed.    Assessment and Plan:        Patient Active Problem List   Diagnosis    Breast cancer, left breast   58 year old postmenopausal woman with a T2N1 grade 2 IDC with a reported Ki67 of 30% on her core biopsy.  HER2 was retested on the surgical sample and showed no gene amplification by FISH.  Long discussion of the pathology and the goal of therapy.  She did not understand the relationship between the cancer she currently has, her genetic testing 
 and the risk of distant recurrence. We discussed this at length.  She does not know if she has had expanded panel testing or BRCA testing only.    We also discussed her pathology report which shows a possible small area of positivity at the deep margin on the re-resection sample, as well as additional multifocal disease.  I believe that the fascia was removed, so this will be managed by radiation therapy.    Given the extent of her cancer, I would recommend adjuvant chemotherapy.  We will need to review her pathology and also discuss whether any additional node sampling is required or whether she can proceed to radiation without further surgery.  LIkely give the fact that she needs radiation already, the best approach will be radiation without further node sampling.    We discussed types of chemotherapy, her options include AC/weekly T or TC x 4 chemotherapy. Given recent data suggesting similar outcome in hormone receptor positive disease with these two regimens, and less toxicity with TC as well better hair preservation with scalp cooling - which is very important to her in particular.  I think it is reasonable to go with TC x 6 based on these recent studies.    We discussed scalp cooling and the risk of hair loss, which she also discussed with our scalp cooling coordinator.  She understands that this is not a guarantee for success.    She is most concerned about having a port, but understands that getting chemotherapy in her right arm with poor baseline access is not feasible.  We reviewed the port placement and what it will look like.    She is unhappy with her cosmesis in the left breast.  I explained that we have to wait for the area to be fully healed and that she could see a plastic surgeon before radiation to consider whether additional surgery would be useful.    Plan  Submit authorization for TC x 6 with ONPRO support  Referral for chemotherapy teaching, port placement  Staging with 
 PET/CT  Baseline echo although not receiving AC as planned so far  Start 07/09/17 with dignicap.    Path review (review Ki67)    Discuss cosmetics when the left breast is better healed.    Patient ready and able to be educated, verbalizes understanding of information/instructions given.  Treatment options, side effects and nutrition reviewed in detail.

train_20	0	"HPI:  ***** ***** is a 32 y.o. female here for a discussion of treatment options for recently diagnosed left breast cancer. Her history is as follows:    ***** underwent genetic testing in early 2018 due to family history of breast cancer diagnosed around age 30. The Myriad myRisk panel identified a mutation in the ATM gene (c1109dup (p.Tyr370*) heterozygous). In December 2017, she palpated a left breast lump and presented to PCP. On 01/10/18, a left breast US at ***** ***** ***** demonstrated an irregularly marginated mass with internal vascularity at 5:00, 4-5cm from the nipple. On 01/12/18 left diagnostic mammogram at ***** ***** ***** found an irregular 15 mm mass at 5 o'clock, 5cm from the nipple.    On  01/24/18 an US-guided core biopsy of the left breast mass at ***** ***** ***** revealed a grade 2 invasive ductal carcinoma measuring 8mm. The cancer is ER positive (>95%), PR positive (<5%), HER2 negative (by FISH), Ki67 44%.    On 02/06/18, an US of left axilla noted multiple lymph nodes, largest measuring 1.2 x 1.5 x 0.5cm and smallest 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4cm. The small node was echogenic throughout. The two slightly larger nodes showed normal hilar echogenicity with a hypoechoic rim. No architectural distortion was noted. On 02/14/18, an FNA of a left axillary lymph node was attempted in ***** and the path was benign. The report described a few benign mesenchymal cells admixed with lymphocytes and peripheral blood cell elements, and no malignant cells identified.    On 02/17/18, a diagnostic mammogram of right breast showed no evidence of malignancy. On 02/22/18, the patient came to ***** for a second opinion with Dr. *****.     She underwent bilateral breast MRI on 03/16/18. In the right breast, there is a 9 mm oval mass with smooth margins and dark internal septation in the upper outer right breast. Findings are classic for fibroadenoma. There was no abnormal areas of enhancement or 
 other MRI features of malignancy  on the right. In the LEFT breast, there is a 2.5 cm x 2.2 cm  x 2.3 cm oval mass with irregular margins and heterogeneous enhancement in the lower outer left breast. There is also at least two abnormal lymph nodes in the left axilla level I and I/II with cortical thickening, measuring up to 6 mm.     She was seen by Radiation Oncology at ***** yesterday who were not enthusiastic about offering this patient radiation based on her ATM mutation, and therefore recommended she proceed with mastectomy. She was seen in ***** today and Dr. ***** has recommended a repeat FNA of the left axilla.     Subsequent to the visit, the Mammaprint from her prior core biopsy came back as High Risk (-0.622)    History reviewed. No pertinent past medical history.

Comparison:  Prior examination dated 01/12/2018 was reviewed for comparison.    MRI Technique:  Bilateral 1.5T breast MRI 
 without and with contrast was performed with a dedicated breast coil using T1 and T2-weighted sequences including:  axial T2-weighted with fat saturation, high resolution T1 fat-suppressed 3D gradient echo pre-, and dynamic post-contrast sequences. Gadolinium based contrast was injected intravenously at a dose of 0.1 millimole per kilogram body weight without adverse reaction.    The study was processed with a Hologic Aegis Sentinelle system to optimize interpretation by generating multiplanar reconstructions (MPRs) and maximum intensity projections (MIPs) in 3 dimensions using raw and generated subtracted images from the dynamic contrast enhanced data set.    MRI Findings:  This bilateral breast MRI exam demonstrates mild background enhancement.  The breasts are composed of heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue and fat.    RIGHT Breast:  There is a 9 mm oval mass with smooth margins and dark internal septation in the upper outer right breast. Signal intensity/time curve demonstrates slow initial rise and persistent enhancement kinetics.All findings classic for fibroadenoma.  No abnormal areas of enhancement or other MRI features of malignancy are identified. Findings are best seen on post-contrast axial image #66 and sagittal image #603.    LEFT Breast:  There is a 2.5 cm (AP) x 2.2 cm (TV) x 2.3 cm (CC) oval mass with irregular margins and heterogeneous enhancement in the lower outer left breast. Signal intensity/time curve demonstrates rapid initial rise and washout enhancement kinetics. Findings are best seen on post-contrast axial image #87 and sagittal image #118.    Other: At least two abnormal lymph nodes in the left axilla level I and I/II with cortical thickening, measuring up to 6 mm. Findings are best seen on post-contrast axial images #24 and 55.    IMPRESSION:   Left breast: Known biopsy proven malignancy (BI-RADS 6).  Right breast: Benign (BI-RADS 2).    Recommendations:  1. Recommend continued 
 surgical/oncological management for knwon left breast malignancy.    Pathology results reviewed and discussed with the patient:    Assessment and Plan:  ***** ***** is a 32 y.o. female ATM mutation carrier with a clinical T2NX ER+/PR-/HER2 negative left breast. Subsequent to our clinic visit, the patient underwent a second FNA of the left axillary LNs and it again showed no cancer. Because of her ATM mutation, radiation oncology has recommended that she proceed with mastectomy rather than breast conserving surgery.     Despite the fact that the patient's tumor is Mammaprint High Risk and I will recommend chemotherapy, I explained to the patient that if she is truly node negative at the time of surgery, we will consider Taxotere and Cytoxan, whereas if she is node positive, she should get AC-Taxol. Therefore in order to make the most appropriate recommendation for chemotherapy, I favor her going to surgery first.    I explained my rationale for this recommendation in detail with the patient and her family and they voiced understanding. I began to explain the differences in the schedule and toxicities for various chemotherapies but will defer and comprehensive conversation until after surgery.    Because her breast cancer is estrogen receptor positive, she understands that she will receive at least five years of adjuvant hormonal therapy.   I briefly introduced the updated data from the SOFT and TEXT trials published in the New England Journal of Medicine in September 2017. Previously published data from this trial demonstrated that for patients who were premenopausal at diagnosis and recovered ovarian function after completion of chemotherapy, the combination of ovarian suppression and an aromatase inhibitor was superior to tamoxifen in terms of preventing distant recurrence. The more recently published data from the SOFT trial shows the 8-year disease-free survival rate was 78.9% with tamoxifen alone, 83.2% with 
 tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression, and 85.9% with exemestane plus ovarian suppression (P=0.009 for tamoxifen alone vs. tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression). Among the women with HER2 negative cancers who received chemotherapy, the 8-year rate of distant recurrence with exemestane plus ovarian suppression was lower than the rate with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression (by 7.0 percentage points in ***** and by 5.0 percentage points in TEXT).     W will have a more thorough discussion regarding choice of hormonal therapy after surgery as well.    Patient ready and able to be educated, verbalizes understanding of information/instructions given.  Treatment options, side effects, clinical trials, and follow up plan were reviewed  in detail.

train_21	0	"ID: ***** ***** is a 81 y.o. postmenopausal patient with a recent diagnosis of breast cancer, who presents in consultation to discuss treatment options and to establish care.    HPI: The patient last had a screening mammogram on 11/06/11 (at 76 years) which was notable for heterogeneously dense breast tissue, but no features of malignancy.  The patient felt a painful mass in her right breast in August 2016.  She presented to her PCP (Dr. *****) of 30+ years on 09/11/16 who noted a firm mobile mass (6 cm) in the right upper outer quadrant of her breast with dimpling of overlying skin.      A diagnostic mammogram on 09/17/16 demonstrated heterogeneously dense breast tissue and a round, indistinct, high density mass (4.1 x 3.3 cm) at the site of the palpable lump, which was in the upper outer right breast, posterior depth.  A targeted ultrasound at that time was notable for a hypoechoic irregular solid mass (2.7 x 2.9 x 3.8 cm) in the upper outer right breast, at the 10:00 position, 9 cm from the nipple.  She underwent a right breast fine needle aspiration at the 10:00 position on 09/17/16.  The pathology was consistent with adenocarcinoma with ER negative, PR negative, and HER2 negative (IHC 0; FISH ratio 1.7).    She established care with Dr. ***** ***** on 09/25/16.  She was offered breast conserving surgery, but preferred mastectomy in an effort to avoid radiation.  ***** underwent a right breast simple mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy on 10/25/16 with Dr. *****.  The pathology was notable for 3.6 cm of grade 3 IDC.  The mitotic count was quite elevated at 74/10 hpf.  The final margins were negative.  Features suggestive of lymphovascular invasion were present.  No DCIS was present.  One of the 2 sentinel lymph nodes was positive for adenocarcinoma (1.2 cm, but no extranodal extension).  Biomarkers were notable for estrogen receptor negative, progesterone receptor negative, HER2 positive (IHC 1; FISH ratio 2.1, 
 but with HER2 sig/nuc 3.0 and Cen17 sig/nuc 1.5), and variable Ki67 expression (<5% to 25-30%; average ~15%).      ***** developed dyspnea on the evening of 11/20/16 and presented to ***** ***** ***** in the context of her known congestive hart failure with left venrticular dysfunction (LVEF 25%).  She was managed with Lasix in the CDU and discharged earlier today.  She presents to clinic with her daughter (*****) and granddaughter (*****).  She feels much better today, back to her baseline with regards to energy and dyspnea.  She has no pain at the site of her breast surgery.

The test for estrogen receptors is negative. There is no nuclear  staining in tumor cells. Internal positive control is present, and  external positive control is appropriate.    The test for progesterone receptors is negative. There is no nuclear  staining in tumor cells. Internal positive control is present, and  external positive control is appropriate.    Result of HER2 test: This carcinoma is negative for HER2 oncoprotein  over-expression. The staining intensity of this carcinoma was 1 on a  scale of 0-3.    Ki-67 proliferation index: Variable expression ranging from <5% to  25-30%. Overall, it is estimated to be ~15%.       Assessment and Recommendations:  81 y.o. postmenopausal patient with multiple medical comorbidities, including heart failure with LVEF 25% and DM II, who has recently been diagnosed with a Stage II (T2N1) triple negative breast cancer who requires additional testing before final recommendations can be made.    I discussed with the patient and her family the natural history of triple negative breast cancer.  We reviewed the available pathology and imaging reports.  I explained that chemotherapy is the only FDA approved treatment for triple negative breast cancer and that we generally provide chemotherapy to 
 patients with Stage II TNBC.  We then reviewed her multiple medical comorbidities and I stated great concern that our chemotherapy regimens would likely cause her great harm and that she would have a very difficult time tolerating them.  We discussed in brief the regimens of AC/T (which would not be safe in the context of her heart failure), TC (which would not be safe in the context of her heart failure due to fluid shifts as well as her diabetes due to use of dexamethasone), and finally CMF (although less toxic, still introducing great risk).    We discussed the likelihood of recurrence which is quite difficult to assess, but certainly notable in the context of a high grade, node positive, triple negative breast cancer.  We discussed recurrence as both a local and distant concept.      We discussed the role of staging imaging to assess for metastasis at this time.  She is interested in knowing whether or not her disease has already spread and believes she might want to consider a lower risk chemotherapy were she found to have metastasis.  I think that with regards to her other medical issues, it would be of prognostic value at this time to know whether or not she does have metastases. We will obtain a PET/CT and resume our conversation with regards to treatment at that time.     Recommendations in Brief:  - obtain PET/CT    I spent a total of 90 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 85 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the diagnosis, the treatment plan, the prognosis, medication risks, symptoms and therapeutic options.

train_22	0	"ID: ***** ***** ***** is a 67 y.o. postmenopausal patient with a recent diagnosis of early stage breast cancer, who presents in consultation to discuss treatment options and to establish care.    Date of Service: 03/08/17    HPI: The patient underwent a right breast partial mastectomy on 07/06/14 to remove a lipoma; she had no evidence of malignancy at that time. She also underwent an FNA in the right breast at the 9:00 position, 11 cm from the nipple on 11/09/14 which revealed benign breast tissue in association with scar and surgical site changes.  She had normal mammogram in June 2015 and July 2016.  She felt a mass in her right breast in late January and a subsequent evaluation led to a diagnosis of breast cancer.  Evaluation to date is as follows:    07/12/15 screening mammogram: heterogeneously dense breast tissue; no features of malignancy; right breast post-surgical scarring    07/16/16 screening mammogram: heterogeneously dense breast tissue; no mammographic features of malignancy     02/15/17 right diagnostic mammogram: irregular mass with spiculated margins in lower slightly outer right breast, posterior depth; heterogeneously dense breast tissue  Right breast ultrasound: irregular solid mass (2.4 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm) with spiculated margins in lower outer right breast at 7:00 position, 5 cm from nipple (at site of palpable lump); irregular solid mass (1.0 x 1.0 x 0.7 cm) with spiculated margins in lower outer right breast at 8:00 position, 5 cm from nipple (a 2nd smaller palpable lump); non-enlarged morphologically normal appearing LN in right axilla  right breast FNA at 7:00 position, 4 cm from nipple: adenocarcinoma    02/22/17  US-guided core biopsy of right breast mass at 7:00 position, 5 cm from nipple: 1.2 cm grade 2 invasive mammary carcinoma with mixed ductal and lobular features, ER+ >95%, PR+ ~70%, HER2- (IHC 0; FISH ratio 0.65), Ki-67 ~20%  US-guided right breast FNA at 8:00 position, 5 cm from   nipple: adenocarcinoma  US-guided right breast FNA at 7:00 position, 7 cm from nipple: adenocarcinoma    02/19/17 Breast MRI: irregularly shaped mass (2.2 x 2.3 x 2.0 cm) with spiculated margins in lower outer right breast (corresponding to 7:00 position mass on US and palpable-FNA guided biopsy proven carcinoma); in the lower outer right breast, slightly superior and lateral to biopsy proven carcinoma, an irregular enhancing mass (1.5 x 1.2 x 1.8 cm) (corresponding to 8:00 position mass on US); enhancing oval circumscribed mass (0.5 cm) located 1.5 cm directly posterior to 7:00 position mass with faint NME extending from posterior aspect of 7:00 position mass to this mass; no adenopathy or chest wall involvement; left breast unremarkable    02/20/17 PET/CT: no evidence of metastatic disease; 2 hypermetabolic enhancing nodules within right breast; sclerotic foci within left ileum, right pubic symphysis, and left ischium likely representing bone islands; mild uptake along distal esophagus (likely esophagitis)    The patient presents to clinic today with her husband.  She feels well and states that she is not surprised by her diagnosis as her paternal great aunts and her mother all suffered from breast cancer and that she has therefore always expected such a diagnosis.  She is active: swims a mile many times a week in the summer, walks a lot on a daily basis, and rides horses.    The patient's gynecologic history is as follows.  She underwent menarche at 12-13 years of age.  She started taking OCP at 16 years of age for very irregular periods at 16.  She is G3P2.  She used Clomid in 30s.  Her first pregnancy was at 30 years of age.  She believes she underwent menopause at 57.  Had nightsweats for years and hot flashes.  She has no history of HRT.

I discussed with the patient 
 and her husband in great detail the natural history and treatment of a MP high risk, clinically high risk, node-negative HR positive breast cancer.  We reviewed the pathology report and discussed the multimodality approach of breast cancer treatment.  I encouraged her that she currently has no evidence of metastatic disease and that we can therefore treat her with curative intent.  The patient understands that her treatment will include chemotherapy, surgery, hormonal therapy, and possibly radiation.  We discussed the advantages of offering chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting in order to assess response to treatment, and to increase the chances of breast conserving surgery.  I discussed the chemotherapy regimens that would be recommended as the standard of care, and discussed how these regimens would be different in the context of the I-SPY2 clinical trial.   The patient was screened for ISPY2 but has already decided that she does not want to participate.      I discussed the regimens typically used for the treatment of HR+ breast cancer when chemotherapy is recommended.  We discussed treatment with AC/T (or T/AC) with 4 cycles of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide (AC) every 2 weeks followed by 12 cycles of weekly paclitaxel.  We also discussed the regimen of docetaxel plus cyclophosphamide (TC), given every 3 weeks for 4 to 6 cycles.  I referred to data from the Anthracyclines in Breast Cancer clinical trial in which patients with node-negative HR+/HER2- breast cancer did not gain additional benefit from taxane/anthracyline regimens over 6 cycles of TC.  I then explained that we do not generally give TC as a neoadjuvant regimen there is no certainty of node-negativity until after surgery and if a patient were to have evidence of positive LN after receiving TC there would be concern that they had not received an anthracycline.    The patient, however, prefers to receive chemotherapy upfront (in light that chemo 
 is recommended) and therefore prefers to proceed with AC/T.  She is aiming for a lumpectomy and at this time would only be able to have a mastectomy.  I specifically discussed with the patient the typical and less common side-effects associated with AC/T, such as fatigue, neuropathy, skin and nail changes, myalgias, alopecia, myelosuppression, nausea).  I stated that patients who receive AC, are at increased risk of cardiotoxicity (acute and distant, 1-3%), which can result in asymptomatic or symptomatic heart failure with dyspnea and chest pain.  I also explained that AC is associated with an increased risk (1-3%) of secondary leukemias.    After an extensive discussion, the patient states that she understands the rationale for neoadjuvant treatment and will proceed with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, specifically AC/T. In order to start treatment, she will first require chemotherapy teaching as well as an echocardiogram.  She also stated interest in cold caps and we will have the CRC contact her to share specific details.   We will additionally have a port placed, which was explained to her and to which she has agreed.    Recommendations in Brief:  - echocardiogram  - chemo teach  - port placement  - discussion with cold cap CRC  - prior auth  - plan to start with AC, ideally first week of March (March 19 or March 20)    The patient will return to clinic in 2 weeks.    I spent a total of 100 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 95 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the diagnosis, the treatment plan, the prognosis, medication risks, lifestyle modification, the risks and benefits of surgery, symptoms and therapeutic options.

train_23	1	"I had the pleasure of seeing ***** ***** for follow up of pancreatic adenocarcinoma at our GI Medical Oncology practice at the UCSF ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center.    Patient Identification and Oncology History  ***** ***** is a 74 y.o. male who initially presented to Dr. ***** on 10/30/15 with weight loss (8 lbs over past month), decline in appetite and difficulty in controlling his blood glucose levels.     On 11/02/15, a CT abdomen was obtained which revealed a 7.5x3.5x3.7cm mass in the tail of the pancreas with thrombosis of splenic vein and marked narrowing and encasement of the splenic artery. There was also mass effect on the proximal peroneal vein at the level of the portal confluence. Portal vein and splenic vein were noted to be narrowed but patent. Radiologist report notes that the mass abuts the superior mesenteric artery along its superior superficial margin as it traverses the pancreas. The loss of fat plane between mass and the antral region of the stomach was suspicious for Direction extension.     Subsequently, an EUS was performed on 11/08/15 which revealed the mass extending from the neck to the tail of the pancreas. Pancreatic ductal dilatation was noted. The mass noted to invade the muscularis propria of the stomach (T4 disease) and was noted to encase the splenic vessels. Due to difficulty in advancing the scope into the duodenum, further evaluation of portal vein, lymph nodes and uncinate process was not possible. However, a large lymph node measuring 2.7 cm was noted adjacent to the celiac axis. EUS staging was at least T4, N1. Cytopathology from the FNA of the pancreatic mass was consistent with adenocarcinoma.   He presented to a local urgent care and then ED on 11/12/15 with bilateral lower extremity weakness and slurred speech which lasted for approximately 20 minutes. It was noted that due to the abdominal and back pain he experienced after the biopsy, patient took marijuana  (smoked/ate) after which he was noted to have the symptoms of weakness and slurred speech.     He saw Dr. ***** on 11/14/15 who recommended systemic treatment with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel and referred the patient to Dr. ***** for potential surgical evaluation. During that visit on November 17, a diagnostic laparoscopy was recommended.     He was seen in our clinic on 11/21/15 when we recommended initiation of systemic therapy with mFOLFIRINOX.    12/05/15: Cycle 1, Day 1 of mFOLFIRINOX (20% dose reduction in irinotecan)    01/03/16: BLE Doppler Ultrasound- Negative for DVT    01/31/16: C5D1 - Admitted from the infusion center after developing dyspnea and chest tightness while receiving irinotecan. In the ED, he was noted to be in afib, CTA neg for PE. Discharged on 02/01/16.     05/14/16: Cycle 12 of mFOLFIRINOX     05/28/2016: Began treatment holiday    Interval History:  *****/*****/*****-*****/*****/***** Presented to the ED with worsening abdominal pain: CT scan showing tumor in pancreatic body/tail causing mass effect on the small intestine in the region of the ligament of Treitz, resulting in partial bowel obstruction. In addition, the CT imaging demonstrates carcinomatosis with peritoneal and omental implants. During this admission, hepatobiliary performed EGD with 5 overlapping stents placed across the malignant duodenal obstruction, with evidence of carcinomatosis of the jejunum as well. A CT scan demonstrated resolution of the intestinal obstruction s/p stent placement, lack of pneumobilia in left biliary system, and moderate ascites from prior. Hepatobiliary does not believe that his discomfort is related to the stents, though he may have free flow of fluid and gas from the more distal small bowel retrograde through the stented intestine as the stents cause lack of normal peristalsis. In addition, it is possible he may have some discomfort from the stent causing back pain (part of the duodenum is retroperitoneal).     08/25/2016: 
 Patient had an NG tube placed    Patient's family presents today with patient simultaneously undergoing xray imaging of his small bowel as an inpatient at *****. His recent CT imaging is most notable for small bowel obstruction. His bilirubin was 3.5mg/dL on 08/24/16. His family voiced some concerns about transitioning the patient to palliative care as he reportedly is still very alert and sentient. They expressed interest in trying to transition him from an NG tube to a blended diet and attempt one final treatment regimen.     Review of Systems  General: no recent fevers or chills.

ASSESSMENT & PLAN  In summary, ***** ***** is a 74 y.o. male who presents to our GI Oncology  practice at the UCSF ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center for a follow-up visit of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with concern for metastatic disease. He was started on systemic therapy with ***** on 12/05/15.  His restaging scans following 4 cycles of chemotherapy were concerning for metastatic disease that is responding to treatment. His CT chest obtained prior to initiation of chemotherapy had revealed nonspecific pulmonary nodules which decreased in size with chemotherapy raising the concern for metastatic involvement. In addition, there were liver lesions noted on the CT abdomen but it was hard to interpret these 
 as the comparison scans were from October (1 month prior to initiation of chemotherapy). His restaging scans from 03/21/16 showed continued treatment response with decrease in the size of the pancreatic mass and the hepatic lesions appearing less conspicuous.  He completed C12 of mFOLFIRINOX on 05/16/2016 and the restaging scans from his last visit revealed stable disease in the pancreatic mass.    On 05/28/2016, he chose to take a treatment holiday vs beginning clinical trial A Phase 2, Multicenter Study of FOLFIRINOX Followed by Ipilimumab in Combination with Allogeneic GM-CSF Transfected Pancreatic Tumor Vaccine in the Treatment of Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer"". Unfortunately, he progressed while on chemotherapy holiday and traveling in ***** as seen on his restaging scans which showed interval disease progression since 05/27/2016, with increased size and infiltration of the pancreatic body/tail mass resulting in new partial bowel obstruction at the ligament of Treitz. New peritoneal and omental nodularity associated with small volume ascites is concerning for progressive peritoneal carcinomatosis; worsening porta hepatis soft tissue infiltration resulting in new biliary obstruction, with moderate right and left-sided intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. He underwent ERCP with stent placement by Dr. ***** on 08/24/16.     At this time, his most recent bilirubin was 3.5mg/dL on 08/24/16 and his 08/25/16 CT imaging is most notable for small bowel obstruction. Given these findings, chemotherapy will likely do more harm than good. We therefore discussed the next best step as palliative care. There is a slight possibility of resuming systemic therapy if his obstruction, bilirubin and oral intake improve which is quite unlikely. I briefly discussed the prognosis of the patient's disease with his family. We further discussed the results of his same day xray of his small bowel which was pending at the time. This showed 
 continued blockage despite stent placement which likely represents functional bowel obstruction as opposed to structural obstruction making further stent placement unlikely to help.     Plan, in brief:  - Continue to follow his PO, obstruction, Bilirubin and Liver function  - Follow up on full report of Xray imaging to the small bowel to determine his ability to undergo additional stent placement.  - Anticipate the need to transition the patient to hospice whether he can undergo further stent placement or not.   - Follow up with the patient on the phone directly    I spent a total of 35 minutes face-to-face with the patient's family, over half of that time in direct counseling regarding the patient's cancer diagnosis.

She reports that she has felt a lot healthier since having her breast surgery.  She has some mld joint stiffness, in particular in her knees.      ***** has met with Dr. ***** ***** and Dr. ***** ***** who have both recommended adjuvant chemotherapy (she states that they have specifically recommended TC).  She states that when she saw Dr. ***** he recommended that her tumor (presumptively left) be sent for Oncotype.  She is not yet aware of a result.    She is concerned that the benefits of chemotherapy will not outweigh its long-term risks.

Assessment and Recommendations:  55 y.o. postmenopausal patient with a recent diagnosis of bilateral breast cancer who should proceed with adjuvant chemotherapy in the context of clinically and genomically high risk disease in the left breast.       I discussed with 
 the patient in great detail the natural history and treatment of early stage HR+/HER2- breast cancer.  We reviewed the available imaging and pathology reports.  I noted that she had 2 breast cancers with very different features.  Specifically, she has a Stage III (T3N1) HR+/HER2- grade 3 IDC of the left breast (MP high risk -0.614) and a Stage I (T1cN0) HR+/HER2- grade 1 IDC of the right breast (MP low risk).    With regards to her left breast cancer, I noted the high clinical risk features, including tumor size, lymph node status, and grade.  I explained that with the above clinical characteristics, patients would historically be recommended chemotherapy. I then introduced the utility of genomic profiling of the tumor (with tools like MammaPrint and Oncotype) to predict recurrence risk and benefit from chemotherapy. I noted that in the MINDACT clinical trial all patients with both high clinical risk and high genomic risk were recommended chemotherapy and that patients with such characteristics have not been studied with randomization to receive or not receive chemotherapy.  I stated that the addition of chemotherapy was important to reduce distant recurrence risk and that I would expect that benefit to be an absolute reduction in DFS of ~8%.  Her tumor is apparently being assessed for Oncotype DX RS.  I stated that I have seen some discordance between these two tests, and that were she found to have intermediate or high risk disease with Oncotype I would still recommend chemotherapy, but if she had low risk disease it would be both unexpected and difficult to reconcile - I would want to discuss the result at that time.  I noted that TAILORx does not apply to her given her positive LN, even as a micrometastasis.    I stated that with regards to chemotherapy regimens, I would recommend TC x 4 cycles over AC/T in the context of the ABC clinical trials and that she had only 1 positive LN.  We discussed extensively the 
 typical SE associated with TC chemotherapy, including fatigue, myelosuppression, joint pain, myalgias, fluid retention, finger nail changes, alopecia, and cognitive dysfunction.    With regards to her right breast cancer, I noted the low clinical risk features, including tumor size, clear LN status, grade, and biomarker status.  I noted that chemotherapy would not be recommended for this tumor as it would not provide benefit.    I explained in the context of HR+/HER2- breast cancers, regardless of other therapy decisions, anti-estrogen therapy was the most important part of treatment her moving forward.  I explained that the standard, first-line recommendation for adjuvant anti-estrogen therapy in a post-menopausal patient with HR+/HER2- breast cancer is an aromatase inhibitor (AI), which blocks the conversion of androgen to estrogen, reducing the total body estrogen supply. I discussed the typical side-effects, including hot flashes, arthralgias, vaginal dryness, and bone density loss. I recommend that she take an AI for at least 5 years and that this would not start until after chemotherapy, and radiation.    I stated she would need a DEXA to assess her current bone health. We discussed ways to improve her bone health, such as weight bearing exercise. She will also take calcium and vitamin D. We also discussed the importance of aerobic activity (150 minutes a week), which she does appear to currently achieve through daily walking.      Recommendations in Brief:  - docetaxel/cyclophosphamide x 4 cycles  - radiation  - AI therapy for at least 5 years  - consider adjuvant trial of a CDK4/6 inhibitor    I spent a total of 120 minutes face-to-face with the patient and 115 minutes of that time was spent counseling regarding the diagnosis, the treatment plan, the prognosis, medication risks, lifestyle modification, symptoms and therapeutic options.

train_25	1	"  SUBJECTIVE:  This is a very pleasant 65-year-old woman from ***** who was admitted to the hospital recently for pneumonia. An abdominal CT scan was done during her admission with an incidental finding of a pancreatic mass in the tail of the pancreas. Fine needle aspiration of the mass by EUS showed adenocarcinoma. She has subsequently had a pancreas protocol CT scan at *****. This did not show any evidence of metastatic disease. The mass in the distal necrotic body measures 3.9 cm and is localized to the pancreas. She's been seen by GI surgical oncology at *****.    She has been presented at tumor Board. Although she was  technically resectable, it was felt that she might benefit from neoadjuvant therapy. She was started on gemcitabine and Abraxane. She only received 2 doses. With each administration, she developed severe adverse events including metabolic abnormalities with hypercalcemia and hyponatremia as well as total body aches. She was hospitalized each time. With that reason, we elected to stop preoperative therapy and refer her for surgery.    On 03/01/22, she underwent a distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy. She was found to have a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with negative margins and 2 of 29 lymph nodes were positive. Her postoperative course was complicated by an infection and abscess which required ERCP for drainage.    We recommended postoperative gemcitabine and capecitabine using an alternate week schedule. She has had 2 cycles. She has tolerated it quite poorly. She's had mucositis and severe hand-foot syndrome with cracking and blistering. She has refused dose modification. She's also been falling and is not quite sure why. She does not describe vertigo but seemed to lose her balance. She has now using a walker.    She is very fatigued and sleeps about 12 hours in a 24 hour timeframe. She feels that she can only handle one event a day. She can walk a few blocks. She has 
 musculoskeletal pain and takes Tylenol, Flexeril and gabapentin. Fortunately, her appetite is good and she has not lost any weight. She is having one to 2 loose bowel movements a day.    She has had some genetic testing in the past and is known to carry an ATM VUS.

With regard to her PE, we will start her on Lovenox. We will also get Dopplers to understand whether she has DVT. She is very agreeable to doing Lovenox as she has done it before.  .  I performed this evaluation using real-time telehealth tools, including a live video Zoom connection between my location and the patient's location. Prior to initiating, the patient consented to perform this evaluation using telehealth tools.    I spent a total of 40 minutes on this patient's care on the day of their visit excluding time spent related to any billed procedures.

train_26	1	"Subjective:    This is a very pleasant 63-year-old African American woman from ***** ***** with the aforementioned diagnosis.  She presented in February with abdominal discomfort, bloating and eventually jaundice.  A metal stent was placed on May 29 and since then, she has been relatively asymptomatic. CT scan at that time revealed a mass in the head of the pancreas and a 2 cm adrenal mass.  A followup PET/CT in June suggested that only the mass in the pancreas was PET avid.  An ultrasound of the pelvis done on June 05 shows a 3.2 cm fibroid in the fundus of the uterus and thickened endometrium.  No adnexal masses were seen. EUS done on May 29 suggested encasement of the hepatic artery and invasion into the portal vein.  FNA of the pancreas revealed adenocarcinoma    When we initially saw her we repeated her pancreas protocol CT scan. We were concerned about the possibility of peritoneal carcinomatosis.  She underwent a laparoscopy which was unremarkable.  There was a small amount of ascites in the pelvic region but washings were negative.  A small lesion in the liver was biopsied and this recovered elements of a cyst.    After her laparoscopy, she developed pleuritic chest pain and some shortness of breath.  She was evaluated for a PE in the emergency room and CT scan was unremarkable although she was noted to have some interlobular septal thickening and a ground glass opacities.    We then started her on treatment with modified FOLFIRINOX. She completed 12 cycles. At that point, she is really evaluated for surgical resection. On March 22, she underwent a pylorus-preserving pancreatectomy with open cholecystectomy and portal vein and hepatic artery resection and interposition graft. Surgical pathology revealed a 1.7 cm residual tumor mass within estimation of 51-90% of tumor cells destroyed. Margins were negative. There were no positive lymph nodes.

IMPRESSION/PLAN:    Impression: This is a premenopausal patient with a recent diagnosis of a bilateral breast cancer measuring >10 and 9 cam  cm and involving unknown number lymph nodes: The tumor is ER-+ on both sides and HER2 positive on the right. 
       .    The discussions today were based on the assumption that the review of outside records and pathology confirms the current diagnosis. All recommendation will be adjusted after final pathology diagnosis, review of path from her original tumor, FISH assessment and final size and lymph node involvement as well as the ultimate surgical approach.       Plan: Based on the tumor characteristics outline above, the patient a candidate for adjuvant therapy.      A HER2 targeting approach with a chemotherapy back bone. Options include an anthracycline followed by a taxane for 4 cycles each or with the current data preferable six cycles of docetaxel and carboplatin. The latter has a reduced cardiac risk.  This would also include Pertuzumab and  Trastuzumab would be given for a total of 1 year. The side effects were discussed but will be further discussed in detail upon final decision.  Hormonal therapy would not start until completion of chemotherapy and radiation therapy.   Once the patient has completed surgery we will initiate all preparatory studies for chemotherapy which may include a port a cath, ECHO cardiogram and appropriate laboratory and staging studies.     Side effects of this regimens were explained and the patient is made aware of the short term and long term risks, including fevers, myeosuppression, cardiac risks and death.     The patient should have a follow up PET/CT         Surgery will be determined by the response over the course  Of the therapy   radiation to both breast     Follow up on lung and liver lesions    Pain and distress: we discussed the level of distress and pain that the diagnosis brings to the patient. No new intervention is necessary.     Diet and exercise: the importance of diet and exercise with regard to breast cancer outcome was re-itinerated   Follow up: after 2 cycles  Reviewed treatment options, treatment side effects in detail.  I reviewed the patient's medical information 
 and medical history. I have reviewed the past medical, family, and social history sections including the medications and allergies listed in the above medical record.    The patient and accompanying family members had ample opportunity to ask questions about the recommendations and follow up and is agreeable to the proposed care plan.

Ms. ***** is a 69 y.o. female whom I am seeing as a video visit new patient at the UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Center in consultation for her metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The history was obtained from the patient, along with my review of all her available  records.    History of Present Illness  This pleasant Cantonese-speaking woman presented to the ***** ***** on 06/26/2021 with 2 months of intermittent epigastric and left sided abdominal pain, along with 15 lbs wt loss, bloating and nausea, acutely worsening on the day of admission. Diagnostic workup at the time included a CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis notable for a mass in the pancreaticoduodenal groove, along with multiple hepatic hypoattenuating lesions suspicious for metastases. She was discharged on oxycodone with arrangement for follow up liver biopsy by I.R., performed on 07/06/2021. This demonstrated adenocarcinoma (MMR by IHC pending).    The patient has since been re-admitted to the hospital on 07/18/2020 due to increasing abdominal pain as well as elevated LFTs/mild jaundice symptoms inc sclericterus. She underwent an ERCP this morning (07/20/2020) with placement of a 10x80 mm Evolution uncovered bare metal stent through a high-grade stricture of the distal CBD. Simultaneous EUS confirmed a 45.8x44.4mm well circumscribed hypoechoic mass in the head of the pancreas, with additional biopsies obtained.    On review of systems, the patient's family notes that she was previously independent with her ADLs. Appetite has been sluggish in the past few weeks, with a weight loss of > 20 lbs. No fevers/chills. She was 
 using primarily Tylenol for pain relief at home, as the oxycodone she had been prescribed was causing some constipation.

Few nonspecific patchy peribronchovascular groundglass opacities in the upper lobes, possibly infectious/inflammatory.       Impression and Recommendations:  In summary, Ms. ***** is a 69 y.o. female with a newly diagnosed metastatic adenocarcinoma of pancreatic origin, causing malignant biliary obstruction for which she has just undergone endobiliary stenting. I will also request somatic tumor testing of the patient's tumor specimen, if there is adequate cellularity, through our in-house UCSF500 platform to assess for the presence of any actionable mutations or other genetic alterations that may inform future treatment options, either using already-approved agents or in the context of clinical trials.     We discussed the details of her cancer diagnosis and why the mainstay of treatment in the setting of stage IV (metastatic) disease should consist of systemic therapy (chemotherapy) with the goal of achieving as deep and durable a remission as possible, hopefully translating into significant prolongation of life, but that treatment was not expected to be curative. As such, it would be important to carefully weigh the risks/benefits of therapy and to prioritize QoL considerations in the process.     In terms of standard of care options, there are several possible chemotherapy regimens to select from for metastatic pancreatic cancer, with the choice of therapy depending on the patient's age, performance status, co-morbid conditions, and personal 
 preference; phase III evidence supports either FOLFIRINOX (biweekly infusional 5-FU, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) or the combination of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel as appropriate front-line choices. In *****. *****'s case, at least based on assessment at today's video visit I would favor going with the combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, although I am willing to re-evaluate/reconsider when I have the opportunity to meet her in person.    From the standpoint of clinical trial options for the first-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer, we have the following here at ***** for which the patient could be considered, if interested and eligible (however, these would delay her being able to start on treatment immediately, and thus we are more likely to proceed with SoC chemotherapy):    - Our Precision Promise clinical trial platform, supported by the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (PanCAN). In the first-line setting, this consists of randomization to either SOC chemotherapy (gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel or FOLFIRINOX); or an experimental therapy arm that presently consists of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel plus pamrevlumab, an anti-CTGF (connective tissue growth factor) monoclonal antibody). Of note, this trial mandates fresh tumor tissue collection both pre- and on-treatment.    - The REVOLUTION (PICI0044) trial, sponsored by the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy (PICI). This trial also employs a platform design intended to test multiple different chemotherapy/immunotherapy combinations; at present, the one cohort open at ***** consists of the combination of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel together with hydroxychloroquine (an anti-autophagy agent) and two doses of low-dose ipilimumab. This trial is non-randomized; and also requires either an adequate amount of archived tumor material or a fresh pre-treatment biopsy for correlative analyses. [CURRENTLY ON HOLD TO ENROLLMENT FOR SAFETY 
 ,PAUSE].    - A phase 1/1b study of TTX-030 (an anti-CD39 antibody) that is being run through our Cancer Immunotherapy Program; this includes a 1st-line pancreas-specific cohort where this agent is being evaluated in combination with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel.    All of the patient's questions were answered to her and her family's satisfaction. We will arrange short-term in-person follow up for both clinical and laboratory assessment (including making sure her LFTs have sufficiently normalized) to get her started on chemotherapy ASAP.      Medical decision-making:  Problems: Her active cancer represents a life-threatening illness.  Risk of complications, morbidity/mortality of patient management: High; the patient's systemic cancer therapy requires regular and intensive monitoring for potential major/life-threatening toxicities.

train_30	1	"SUBJECTIVE:    This is a very pleasant 68-year-old woman who presented with symptoms of small bowel obstruction in early June 2020. She was hospitalized and treated conservatively. CT scan of the abdomen during her hospitalization showed a mass in the tail of the pancreas measuring 4.8 x 3.6 x 2.9 cm. She was also noted to have a complex cyst in her right adnexa. An EUS was done but biopsy was not attempted as there was a large blood vessel running through the mass. CT PET was done which showed that the mass in the tail of the pancreas was PET avid. The cystic pelvic mass was not PET avid.    She was then seen and evaluated by Dr. ***** at *****. A pancreas protocol CT scan was done which revealed extension of the mass to the posterior gastric wall as well as abutment and possible invasion of the left adrenal gland and occlusion of the splenic vein. Dr. ***** recommended neoadjuvant chemotherapy.    We started her on standard schedule gemcitabine and Abraxane. She did not tolerate this well with neutropenia and we switched her to alternate week and she has tolerated that much better. She's now had 4 full cycles and returns for CT evaluation.    She is doing well. She has no cancer pain but take oxycodone for chronic back and shoulder pain. Appetite waxes and wanes but weight is stable. Denies symptoms of neuropathy. Energy level recovers after chemotherapy. She has a facil rash which has come on recently. It's tolerable.    She has been seen by Gyn Onc regarding the right adnexal mass. Assuming she does go to surgery, they would like to coordinate and remove this.    Germ line testing showed no pathologic variants. VUS seen in AXIN1, CTC1, ERCC4, MC1R.

Coronal and sagittal reformats were also obtained. FINDINGS: Visualized lung bases:  For chest findings, please see the separately dictated report from the CT of the chest of the same date. Liver:  Mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation and pneumobilia, stable. Gallbladder: Unchanged position of biliary stent. Gallbladder is unremarkable. Spleen:  Unremarkable Pancreas: Slight improvement in pancreatic ductal dilatation, currently measuring 9 mm (series 14 image 37), previously measuring 12 mm. Ill-defined pancreatic mass not clearly seen. Unchanged appearance of bilobed hypoattenuating cystic lesion in the anterior pancreatic head measuring 8 mm which can represent a sidebranch IPMN (series 14 image 50). Adrenal Glands:  Unremarkable Kidneys:  Similar appearance of left kidney interpolar exophytic 1.1 x 1 cm lesion which is hypodense on noncontrast imaging and hyperenhancing on postcontrast images (series 14 image 31). Right kidney interpole simple cyst measuring 1.5 x 1.1 cm, unchanged. GI Tract:  Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon. Vasculature:  Stable in size mildly prominent subcentimeter periportal and peripancreatic lymph nodes measuring up to 0.7 cm in short axis. Lymphadenopathy: Absent Peritoneum: Unchanged pelvic free fluid. Bladder: Unremarkable Reproductive organs: Unremarkable Bones:  No suspicious lesions Extraperitoneal soft tissues: Unremarkable Lines/drains/medical devices: Biliary stent as

RADIATION DOSE INDICATORS: Exposure Events: 7 , CTDIvol Min: 3.5 mGy, CTDIvol Max: 9.3 mGy, DLP: 628.9 mGy.cm. The following accession numbers are related to this dose report *****,*****,***** *****: LUNGS: No new lung nodules. A few scattered sub-3 mm solid nodules are unchanged compared to multiple remote priors. 16mm mixed solid and groundglass nodule in the left upper lobe (image 84, series 20) with a 3 mm soft tissue component, and adjacent 7 mm groundglass nodule in the left upper lobe (image 81) are unchanged. PLEURA: The pleura is normal. MEDIASTINUM: No intrathoracic lymphadenopathy. HEART/GREAT VESSELS: Unchanged heart size. No pericardial effusion. Thoracic aorta and pulmonary artery are unchanged caliber. BONES/SOFT TISSUES: No new bone or soft tissue lesions in the chest. VISIBLE ABDOMEN: Please see dedicated Abdomen and Pelvis CT report.     1. No new findings to suggest intrathoracic metastatic disease. 2. 2 subsolid left 
 upper lobe nodules likely represent primary lung adenocarcinoma lesions as previously described. The largest nodule is 16 mm with a 3 mm solid component. Report dictated by: ***** ***** *****, MD, signed by: ***** ***** *****, MD Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging    Cancer Staging  Pancreatic cancer (HCC)  Staging form: Exocrine Pancreas, AJCC 8th Edition  - Clinical stage from 02/02/2019: Stage IIB (cT1c, cN1, cM0) - Signed by ***** *****, MD on 02/02/2019    ASSESSMENT & PLAN  In summary, ***** ***** is a 86 y.o. female who presents to our GI Oncology  practice at the UCSF ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center for a follow-up visit of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.     Given her age, comorbidities and preference, she is not a candidate for surgical resection.  As such, the mainstay of treatment for her would be systemic therapy, given with a goal of palliating any symptoms she may have, and achieving as deep and durable a remission as possible, hopefully translating into significant prolongation of life, but this treatment was not expected to be curative.     Patient started dose reduced gemcitabine monotherapy on 03/09/19. She presents for consideration of C2D15 today. This was delayed from last week due to concern for potential dental abscess. Since then, she has been evaluated by her dentist and cleared for chemotherapy today.      Her scans obtained on 05/08/19 showed that the ill-defined pancreatic mass is no longer seen, likely related to treatment. Interval decrease in pancreatic duct dilation. No evidence of metastatic disease. Of note, there was a 1.1 cm left renal enhancing lesion concerning for renal cell carcinoma. 2 subsolid left upper lobe nodules likely represent primary lung adenocarcinoma lesions. The largest nodule is 16 mm with a 3 mm solid component. I reviewed the results of these scans with the patient and her family today. I informed them that due to the agressiveness 
 of the pancreatic cancer, our focus will continue to be treating that. We will monitor the renal lesion and pulmonary nodules closely.    We will continue with gemcitabine monotherapy but we will change to alternating week schedule for better tolerability.    - Plan to continue with monthly CA 19-9 levels and restaging CT cap with contrast every 2 months to monitor treatment response. Her next set of scans will be due after this cycle.     #Left gum pain and bleeding: cleared by her dentist as no sign of infection.   - We will defer to her dentist regarding continued monitoring; pt to continue to chlorhexidine rinses bid.    #Supportive care: Influenza vaccine ordered today (to be given at infusion center). We will refer to nutritionist. She is taking sennokot 4 times per week. I recommended that she take on a daily basis. She has supply of antiemetics and takes as needed. I recommended maintaining her weight and activity level.     #Follow-up: on 05/16/19 with ***** *****. As always, the patient was counseled to contact the clinic or the after-hours physician on call for any new symptoms or complications in the interim between now and her follow up visit with me.    I spent a total of 40minutes face-to-face with the patient and >50% of that time was spent counseling regarding the symptoms, treatment plan, risks and/or therapeutic options for the diagnoses above.    ***** *****, MD, MS  Clinical Assistant Professor in ***** *****   UCSF ***** ***** Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
